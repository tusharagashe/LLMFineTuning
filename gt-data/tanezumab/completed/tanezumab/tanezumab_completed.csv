The Nerve Growth Factor Inhibitor (NGFI) class may offer an important breakthrough in the treatment of chronic pain and is under clinical investigation for the treatment of pain associated with osteoarthritis or other chronic pain conditions.

The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate superior efficacy of tanezumab 5 mg and 2.5 mg administered subcutaneously (SC) every 8 weeks versus placebo at Week 24 in subjects with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip. The 2.5 mg dose was shown to provide efficacy benefits with a favorable safety profile when administered intravenously in previous Phase 3 clinical trials. The 5 mg dose is expected to provide added efficacy benefit over the 2.5 mg dose based on data from previous studies.","This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group multicenter Phase 3 study of the efficacy and safety of tanezumab when administered by SC injection for 24 weeks compared to placebo in subjects with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip. A total of approximately 810 subjects will be randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups in a 1:1:1 ratio (ie, 270/group). The randomization will be stratified by index joint (hip or knee), and most severe Kellgren-Lawrence grade (of any knee or hip joint) at study entry (grade 2, 3 or 4). Subjects will receive up to three SC doses of one of the following treatments at an 8-week interval between each injection:

1. tanezumab 2.5 mg;
2. tanezumab 5 mg;
3. Placebo to match tanezumab. The study is designed with a total (post-randomization) duration of 48 weeks and will consist of three periods: Screening (up to 37 days), Double-blind Treatment (24 weeks) and Safety Follow-up (24 weeks). The Screening Period (beginning up to 37 days prior to Randomization) includes a Washout Period (lasting a minimum of 2 days for all prohibited pain medications), if required, and an Initial Pain Assessment Period (the 7 days prior to Randomization/Baseline).

Week 24 is the landmark analysis in this study. Subjects who do not complete the Double-blind Treatment period will enter and complete the 24-week Early-termination follow-up period.","['Osteoarthritis, Hip', 'Osteoarthritis, Knee']","['Osteoarthritis, pain, tanezumab.']",INTERVENTIONAL,['PHASE3'],RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,TREATMENT,DOUBLE,"['PARTICIPANT', 'INVESTIGATOR']",849,ACTUAL,"[{'label': 'Low dose', 'type': 'EXPERIMENTAL', 'description': 'Investigational product', 'interventionNames': ['Drug: Tanezumab']}, {'label': 'High dose', 'type': 'EXPERIMENTAL', 'description': 'Investigational product', 'interventionNames': ['Drug: Tanezumab']}, {'label': 'Placebo', 'type': 'PLACEBO_COMPARATOR', 'description': 'Investigational product', 'interventionNames': ['Drug: Placebo']}]","[{'type': 'DRUG', 'name': 'Tanezumab', 'description': '2.5 mg', 'armGroupLabels': ['Low dose']}, {'type': 'DRUG', 'name': 'Tanezumab', 'description': '5 mg', 'armGroupLabels': ['High dose']}, {'type': 'DRUG', 'name': 'Placebo', 'description': 'Placebo', 'armGroupLabels': ['Placebo']}]","[{'measure': 'Change From Baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Pain Subscale at Week 24', 'description': 'WOMAC: Self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with osteoarthritis (OA).
