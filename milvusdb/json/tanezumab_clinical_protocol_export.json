The Nerve Growth Factor Inhibitor (NGFI) class may offer an important breakthrough in the treatment of chronic pain and is under clinical investigation for the treatment of pain associated with osteoarthritis or other chronic pain conditions.1\nThe completed Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies conducted to date have demonstrated that tanezumab is efficacious and generally safe and well tolerated for the treatment of pain due to osteoarthritis and chronic low back pain.\nThe primary objective of this study is to demonstrate superior efficacy of tanezumab 5 mg and 2.5 mg administered subcutaneously (SC) every 8 weeks versus placebo at Week 24 in subjects with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip. The 2.5 mg dose was shown to provide efficacy benefits with a favorable safety profile when administered intravenously in previous Phase 3 clinical trials. The 5 mg dose is expected to provide added efficacy benefit over the 2.5 mg dose based on data from previous studies.\nOBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS\nPrimary Objective\n\u2022 Demonstrate superior efficacy of tanezumab 5 mg and 2.5 mg administered subcutaneously (SC) every 8 weeks versus placebo at Week 24.\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE\n\u2022 Evaluate the safety of tanezumab 2.5 mg SC and 5 mg SC.\nPRIMARY ENDPOINTS\nThe co-primary efficacy endpoints are:\n\u2022 Change from Baseline to Week 24 in the Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Pain subscale;\n\u2022 Change from Baseline to Week 24 in the WOMAC Physical Function subscale;\n\u2022 Change from Baseline to Week 24 in the Patient\u2019s Global Assessment of Osteoarthritis.\nSECONDARY ENDPOINTS\nEfficacy Measures\n\u2022 WOMAC Pain subscale change from Baseline to Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 32.\n\u2022 WOMAC Physical Function subscale change from Baseline to Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 32.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 11",

Placebo to match tanezumab.\nThe study is designed with a total post-randomization duration of 48 weeks and will consist of three periods: Screening (up to 37 days), Double-blind Treatment (24 weeks) and Safety Follow-up (24 weeks). The Screening period (beginning up to 37 days prior to Randomization) includes a Washout Period (lasting a minimum of 2 days), if required, and an Initial Pain Assessment Period (the 7 days prior to Baseline [Day 1]).\nSTATISTICAL METHODS\nSample Size Determination\nA sample size of 270 subjects per treatment group is needed to provide approximately 80% power to achieve statistical significance (at the 5% two-sided level) for the two comparisons of tanezumab 2.5 and 5 mg SC versus placebo, over all three co-primary endpoints. The total sample size will be approximately 810 subjects.\nPRIMARY ANALYSIS\nThe co-primary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model, with model terms for Baseline score, Baseline Diary Average Pain, index joint (knee or hip), highest Kellgren-Lawrence grade, and treatment group, and study site as a random effect. The assessment of significance for the tanezumab SC versus placebo treatment contrasts will use a step-down testing strategy within each of the co-primary efficacy endpoints defined as first testing tanezumab 5 mg versus placebo, and if statistically significant (p\u22640.05) to then test tanezumab 2.5 mg versus placebo. Finally, a tanezumab treatment group is declared as superior to placebo if the corresponding treatment contrast is significant over all three co-primary endpoints. This testing procedure will maintain the Type I error to 5% or less within each of the co-primary efficacy endpoints, and to less than 5% for all three co-primary efficacy endpoints. An additional (main effects ANCOVA) analysis for each of the co-primary efficacy endpoints will use a per-protocol analysis set, which will exclude subjects who are major protocol deviators.\nThe primary analysis of the co-primary endpoints will use multiple imputations for missing data, to account for uncertainty around the subject response. The basis for imputing missing values will be dependent on the reasons for missing data. For subjects with missing data due to discontinuation prior to Week 24 for lack of efficacy or for an adverse event or death, imputation will be based on sampling from a normal distribution using a mean value equal to the subject\u2019s Baseline efficacy value and the standard deviation (over all treatment groups) of the observed efficacy data at Week 24. For subjects with missing data for any other reason, imputation will be based on sampling from a normal distribution using a mean value equal to the subject\u2019s last observed efficacy value and standard deviation (over all treatment groups) of the observed efficacy data at Week 24. One hundred imputation samples will be used, and the ANCOVA model described above will be used for each imputation dataset. The final results will be calculated using the combined sets of results from each imputation dataset analysis.2\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 14",

INTRODUCTION\n1.1. Mechanism of Action/Indication\nTanezumab (PF-04383119, formerly RN624) is an anti-nerve growth factor monoclonal antibody under development for the relief of signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis (OA). Full details can be found in the Investigator\u2019s Brochure.1\n1.2. Background and Rationale\n1.2.1. Role of Nerve Growth Factor in the Modulation of Pain\nDuring mammalian development, nerve growth factor (NGF) is required for the survival and growth of several populations of neurons. In adults, the effect of NGF signaling shifts from the regulation of neuronal survival to the regulation of neuronal phenotype and function The role of NGF in the adult mammal appears to principally be as a modulator of nociceptive neuronal activity and modulation of the pain response Many non-clinical studies employing a variety of antibodies to NGF or IgG fusion proteins coupled to tropomyosin receptor kinase A (trkA; one of the primary receptors r NGF) have demonstrated that blocking NGF bioactivity normalizes pain sensitivity.* Together these observations suggest that NGF may play a role in pain secondary to inflammation or injury.\n1.2.2. Description of Investigational Product\nTanezumab is a humanized immunoglobulin G Type 2 (IgG2) monoclonal antibody, derived from a murine precursor with a mutation in the Fc portion of the antibody to decrease its ability to activate complement or to support antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity.6,7 Tanezumab is highly potent in sequestering NGF and preventing interaction with the trkA or p75 receptors.\n1.2.3. Overview of Clinical Studies\nA total of 32 clinical studies involving over 11,000 subjects have been conducted with tanezumab as of September 2014. Most of these studies were conducted in subjects with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip. A total of 17 clinical studies (4 Phase 2 studies and 13 Phase 3 studies [10 controlled]) were initiated to provide evidence of efficacy and safety of tanezumab with intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) administration for the relief of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis alone or in combination with non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In addition to the osteoarthritis studies, 11 Phase 1/2 studies were conducted to examine the efficacy and safety of tanezumab in other musculoskeletal, neuropathic, and visceral chronic pain conditions, and 2 Phase 2 studies were conducted in cancer subjects with metastatic bone pain. In these studies, tanezumab was administered by IV or SC administration every 8 weeks at fixed doses ranging from 1 mg to 20 mg or equivalent body-weight adjusted doses up to 100 mg.\nRobust efficacy was demonstrated in osteoarthritis and chronic low back pain studies. Efficacy and safety results observed in non-cancer pain populations are described in the tanezumab Investigator\u2019s Brochure1 and in external publications of individual studies.8,9,10,11,12,15\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 26",

Overview of Efficacy in Osteoarthritis Clinical Studies\nAcross the 3 co-primary measures of efficacy in four completed Phase 3 studies of tanezumab monotherapy (IV administration), doses of 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg provided significant improvement over placebo treatment. All of the tanezumab doses tested were consistently efficacious. In Studies A40910118 and A40910149,the degree of mean improvement across the three efficacy domains was similar and generally dose ordered with tanezumab 10 mg providing the greatest mean response in each of the 6 comparisons to placebo treatment although only small differences in the magnitude of response were evident among the three doses of tanezumab. In Studies A409101510 and A409101810, tanezumab 5 mg provided modestly greater mean improvement over tanezumab 10 mg across most of the co-primary endpoints.\nFurther details on the efficacy of tanezumab on osteoarthritis can be found in the Investigator\u2019s Brochure (IB).1\n1.2.3.2. Overview of Safety in Clinical Studies\nBased on data from all subject populations who have received tanezumab in completed clinical studies to date, the adverse drug reactions listed Table 3 are considered to be expected in subjects who are treated with tanezumab.\nTable 3.

The incidence of adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse events, and serious adverse events in subjects treated with tanezumab monotherapy (5-10 mg) was similar to subjects receiving active comparator treatment and increased over placebo-treated subjects. In the tanezumab 2.5 mg monotherapy treatment group, the incidence of adverse events was similar to active comparator while the incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events, and serious adverse events was similar to that of the placebo treatment group. Across the tanezumab monotherapy doses, the rates of adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse events, and serious adverse events, were similar with tanezumab 5 mg and 10 mg, and elevated in comparison to tanezumab 2.5 mg. Tanezumab/NSAID combination therapy was associated with higher overall adverse event rates. The relationship of incidence to the dose of tanezumab administered was similar to that seen with tanezumab monotherapy.\nBased on data from the Phase 3 osteoarthritis studies and results of an independent adjudication of investigator-reported adverse events of osteonecrosis and total joint replacements, the risk of rapidly progressive osteoarthritis with tanezumab treatment was greater than with placebo or active comparator treatment.\nAmong the most frequently reported adverse events in the controlled Phase 3 osteoarthritis studies, the incidence of peripheral edema, upper respiratory tract infection, fall, arthralgia, back pain, joint swelling, pain in extremity, hypoesthesia, and paresthesia tended to be higher in subjects receiving tanezumab monotherapy than subjects receiving either placebo or active comparator treatment. The incidence of peripheral edema, arthralgia, joint swelling, pain in extremity, and paresthesia increased with increasing doses of tanezumab monotherapy. The adverse events with increased incidence observed with active comparator over tanezumab monotherapy included the following: constipation, nausea, urinary tract infection, nasopharyngitis, osteoarthritis, and hypertension.\nThe most common adverse events reported in the non-controlled, long-term Phase 3 osteoarthritis studies were similar to those seen in the controlled Phase 3 osteoarthritis studies with the exception of the inclusion of musculoskeletal pain and exclusion of hypertension and nasopharyngitis and all gastrointestinal-related adverse events. Dose-related increases in the incidence of peripheral edema, joint swelling, osteoarthritis and paresthesia were observed.\n1.2.3.2.1. Sympathetic Nervous System\nIn completed Phase 3 osteoarthritis studies, the incidence and discontinuation rates due to adverse events consistent with decreased sympathetic function associated with tanezumab monotherapy (combined doses of 2.5 to 10 mg) were less than or equal to rates with placebo or active comparator. No evidence of dose related elevations in the frequency of adverse events suggestive of decreased sympathetic nervous system function were observed at doses of 2.5 to 10 mg in subjects with osteoarthritis. Tanezumab 20 mg in chronic low back pain had marginally higher event rates compared to placebo and active comparator treatment groups.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 28",

Joint Safety\nA comprehensive investigation and analyses related to joint-safety has been conducted, based on tanezumab monotherapy exposure in over 6400 subjects and tanezumab/NSAID combination therapy in 3400 subjects. There were over 5000 subjects who received tanezumab treatment alone or in combination with NSAIDs for 6 months or longer. The program was sufficient to define and characterize the adverse event of concern \u2013 rapidly progressive osteoarthritis \u2013 and evaluate the risk of rapidly progressive osteoarthritis in the context of the overall benefit-risk profile of tanezumab compared to standard of care. The results and conclusions regarding tanezumab and the other anti-NGF therapies are provided in detail elsewhere.1\nAfter careful investigation, no evidence was found to substantiate that tanezumab is associated with an increased risk of osteonecrosis, a disease process quite distinct from osteoarthritis. A risk of rapidly progressive osteoarthritis was identified. The risk of rapidly progressive osteoarthritis with tanezumab monotherapy was well below that observed with tanezumab/NSAID combination therapy but greater than with placebo or active comparator treatment. A majority of subjects identified with rapidly progressive osteoarthritis had advanced osteoarthritis of the affected joint prior to treatment. The event rate of all-cause joint replacements in subjects with osteoarthritis was comparable among placebo, active comparator, and tanezumab monotherapy treatment groups. Further details can be found in the IB.1\nRisk mitigation measures have been developed as an outgrowth of the joint-related safety analyses to reduce the risk of rapidly progressive osteoarthritis. Using recommendations from discussions with European agencies [United Kingdom\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), Germany\u2019s Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI) and Spain\u2019s Agency on Medicinal Products and Medical Devices (AEMPS)] as well as the 2012 FDA Arthritis Advisory Committee and interactions with FDA, risk mitigation measures were developed. These risk mitigation measures have been included in this study and are outlined as follows:\nRisk Minimization: (1) exclude chronic concomitant NSAID use, (2) exclude tanezumab doses that have been explored and do not demonstrate benefit over lower doses in the condition under study, (3) exclude subjects with evidence of rapidly progressive osteoarthritis or risk factors for such from participating in clinical studies, (4) discontinue\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 29",

Subcutaneous Administration of Tanezumab in Clinical Studies\nThe formulation of tanezumab that has been administered by SC injection is identical to what has been administered by IV infusion and is administered as a 1 mL SC injection in the thigh or abdomen. The safety and efficacy of tanezumab when administered by SC injection has been evaluated in OA subjects primarily in two studies, A409102713 and A4091043,14 and in subjects with chronic low back pain in one study (A409103915). A total of 1905 subjects were treated in these studies. The observed efficacy and safety profile of tanezumab administered SC was similar to IV administration.\n1.2.4. Dose Selection Rationale\nIntravenous and SC administration of tanezumab at doses of 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg was shown to reduce pain and improve function in a dose-related manner in Phase 3 studies of osteoarthritis. As one of the risk mitigation features identified through analysis of orthopedic safety and efficacy data, no further study of the tanezumab 10 mg dose will be conducted in subjects with osteoarthritis as this dose did not provide sufficient additional efficacy benefit over the 5 mg dose. The 5 mg dose is expected to provide added efficacy benefit over the 2.5 mg dose. Based upon prior studies, this additional efficacy benefit is likely to be most evident in subjects considered to have severe symptomatic osteoarthritis as defined above in Section 1.2.3.1. The current study will therefore investigate the safety and efficacy of fixed- dose levels of tanezumab 2.5 mg and 5 mg administered up to 3 times at 8-week intervals relative to placebo.\n1.2.5. Rationale for Placebo Treatment\nThe use of a placebo comparator is the gold-standard for assessing efficacy in short-term pain studies. Utilization of placebo as a comparator allows a smaller sample size and thus demonstrates the study objectives of efficacy more efficiently than a study using an active comparator. In addition, the use of a placebo arm is most important when the trial endpoints are subjective measures such as those used in this study, because of the often great variation in the way individuals perceive subject-reported outcomes. This was reported to be particularly relevant for studies involving pain relief, depression, and asthma.16 In this study SC placebo is used to blind investigators and subjects as to whether or not SC tanezumab has been administered. Although no analgesic efficacy is expected from placebo treatment, some\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 30",

Rescue medication (acetaminophen/paracetamol) will be allowed to all subjects throughout the study (refer to Section 5.8).\n1.2.6. Subject Population Selection Rationale\nThe population selected for this study is subjects with moderate to severe osteoarthritis pain of the hip or knee based on American College of Rheumatology criteria with X-ray confirmation (a Kellgren-Lawrence x-ray grade of \u22652) who have had inadequate pain relief with previous conventional pharmacological treatment options for osteoarthritis, or who are unable to take these medications due to a contraindication or the inability to tolerate them and who are seeking effective treatment options other than or prior to joint replacement. The rationale for the choice of this population is to optimize the potential benefit:risk relationship for subjects entering the study by selecting subjects who have pain that is more severe or treatment resistant and who have limited treatment options remaining.\nComplete information for this compound may be found in the Single Reference Safety Document, which for this study is the Investigator\u2019s Brochure.1\n1.2.7. Benefit-Risk Assessment.\nThe determination of the benefit-risk assessment must take into account the efficacy and safety of tanezumab, and the population to be studied in this protocol.\nTanezumab has been studied for use in moderate to severe chronic pain conditions including osteoarthritis. Data from the available Phase 2 and 3 studies has shown that tanezumab treatment provides significant improvements in pain, physical function and global assessment in osteoarthritis compared with placebo, NSAID and opiate treatment.\nConcerning safety, relative to placebo, tanezumab monotherapy and active comparator treatment groups, tanezumab/NSAID treatment groups were associated with the highest overall adverse event rate and rate of discontinuations due to adverse events in Phase 3 osteoarthritis studies. The incidence of adverse events and discontinuations due to adverse events in Phase 3 studies in patients with osteoarthritis increased with increasing tanezumab dose and with the combination of tanezumab and NSAID. (See Investigator\u2019s Brochure Section 6.2.1.)\nThe rate of all-cause total joint replacements (patients who underwent total joint replacement + patients with reported osteonecrosis regardless of whether they underwent total joint replacement or not) in patients with osteoarthritis was comparable between placebo, active comparator and tanezumab monotherapy treatment groups. The rate of all-cause total joint replacements did not increase with increasing tanezumab monotherapy dose. (See Investigator\u2019s Brochure Section 6.2.10 and Section 1.2.3.2.2 of Protocol A4091057). The rate of rapidly progressive osteoarthritis increased with increasing tanezumab dose and was elevated above the rate observed in placebo and active comparator treatment groups. The combination of tanezumab + NSAID treatment increased the rate of rapidly progressive osteoarthritis and all-cause total joint replacement by >2 to 3-fold above other treatment\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 31",

Because of those findings, risk mitigation measures have been incorporated into the protocol (see Section 1.2.3.2.2).\nAdverse events of abnormal peripheral sensation with tanezumab treatment have been observed in all patient populations studied to date. The adverse events are dose-related, generally resolve and are of mild-to-moderate intensity at the doses planned for future studies. (See Investigator\u2019s Brochure Section 6.2.11).\nBased upon quantitative sensory testing, intraepidermal nerve fiber density, nerve conduction velocity testing and heart rate deep breathing assessments conducted to-date, administration of tanezumab does not have a clinically meaningful effect on sensory or autonomic nerve function based on data in heathy volunteers or patients with osteoarthritis or painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (See Investigator\u2019s Brochure Section 6.2.11.4).\nClinically meaningful changes in vital signs, laboratory values, or electrocardiograms (ECG) (including QTc) have not been observed to-date (See Investigator\u2019s Brochure Section 6.2).\nIn summary, tanezumab treatment has been shown to provide significant improvements in pain, physical function and global assessment in osteoarthritis compared to placebo, NSAID and opiate treatment. The benefit to subjects participating in the study will be the potential for improvement in osteoarthritis pain that has not been adequately relieved by previous treatment regimens.\nBased on the overall assessment of risk and benefit, the data support further clinical investigation of tanezumab with the additional benefit-risk optimization and surveillance measures employed as outlined in the protocol.\n2.

A total of approximately 810 subjects will be randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups in a 1:1:1 ratio (ie, 270/group). The randomization will be stratified by index joint (hip or knee), and most severe Kellgren-Lawrence grade (of any knee or hip joint) at study entry (grade 2, 3 or 4). Subjects will receive up to three SC doses of one of the following treatments at an 8-week interval between each injection:\n1. tanezumab 2.5 mg;\n2. tanezumab 5 mg;\n3. Placebo to match tanezumab.\nThe study is designed with a total (post-randomization) duration of 48 weeks and will consist of three periods: Screening (up to 37 days), Double-blind Treatment (24 weeks) and Safety Follow-up (24 weeks). The Screening Period (beginning up to 37 days prior to Randomization) includes a Washout Period (lasting a minimum of 2 days for all prohibited pain medications), if required, and an Initial Pain Assessment Period (the 7 days prior to Randomization/Baseline).\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 35",

The investigator or his or her designee, in consultation with the subject, will confirm that the subject has selected the appropriate methods of contraception for the individual subject from the permitted list of contraception methods (see below) and instruct the subject in its consistent and correct use. Subjects need to affirm that they meet the criteria for correct use of at least two of the selected methods of contraception. The investigator or his or her designee will discuss with the subject the need to use highly effective contraception consistently and correctly according to the schedule of activities and document such conversation in the subject\u2019s chart. In addition, the investigator or his/or her designee will instruct the subject to call immediately if the selected contraception methods are discontinued or if pregnancy is known or suspected in the subject or the subject\u2019s partner.\nHighly effective methods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly (ie, perfect use) and include, with the exception of number 3 which is an acceptable birth control method:\n1. Established use of oral, inserted, injected, implanted, or transdermal hormonal methods of contraception is allowed provided the subject plans to remain on the same treatment throughout the entire study and has been using that hormonal contraceptive for an adequate period of time to ensure effectiveness, with the exception of oral low-dose progestogens for which inhibition of ovulation is not the primary mode of action, and therefore such a method is not considered a highly effective contraceptive method.\n2.

The contact card contains, at a minimum, protocol and investigational compound identifiers, subject study numbers, contact information for the investigational site and contact details for a contact center in the event that the investigational site staff cannot be reached to provide advice on a medical question or problem originating from another healthcare professional not involved in the subject\u2019s participation in the study. The contact center number can also be used by investigational staff if they are seeking advice on medical questions or problems; however, it should be used only in the event that the established communication pathways between the investigational site and the study team are not available. It is therefore intended to augment, but not replace the established communication pathways between the investigational site and the study team for advice on medical questions or problems that may arise during the study. The contact number is not intended for use by the subject directly, and if a subject calls that number, he or she will be directed back to the investigational site.\n5. STUDY TREATMENTS\nFor the purposes of this study, and per International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines investigational product is defined as a pharmaceutical form of an active ingredient or placebo being tested or used as a reference in a clinical trial, including a product with a marketing authorization when used or assembled (formulated or packaged) in a way different from the approved form, or when used for an unapproved indication, or when used to gain further information about an approved use (ICH E6 1.33).\n5.1. Allocation to Treatment\nSubjects will be randomized at Baseline to one of the following treatment groups, all subjects will receive SC treatment during the Double-blind Treatment period of the study:\nTreatment Group Subcutaneous Treatment (SC) 1 Placebo for tanezumab once every 8 weeks x 3 doses 2 Tanezumab 2.5 mg once every 8 weeks x 3 doses 3 Tanezumab 5 mg once every 8 weeks x 3 doses\nSubjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to the above treatment regimens according to a computer generated randomization schedule. The randomization will be stratified by index joint (hip or knee), and most severe Kellgren-Lawrence grade (of any knee or hip joint) at study entry (grade 2, 3 or 4). This will result in a 6-group stratified randomization scheme as follows:\n1. Subjects with osteoarthritis of the hip and highest Kellgren-Lawrence grade of 2;\n2. Subjects with osteoarthritis of the hip and highest Kellgren-Lawrence grade of 3;\n3. Subjects with osteoarthritis of the hip and highest Kellgren-Lawrence grade of 4;\n4.

The randomization code will be securely maintained by a person(s) who is independent of the trial conduct and produces the randomization code. It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to ensure that the subject is eligible for participation in the study before requesting Randomization. The study site will obtain the subject\u2019s randomization number and dispensable unit identification numbers (ie, the drug supply to be administered) from the IRT. Further details will be provided in the Pharmacist Manual.\n5.2. Breaking the Blind\nThis is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study. The subjects, Investigators, Study Coordinators, clinical site staff, Clinical Research Associate (CRA), and staff directly involved with the study at Pfizer and its designees will be blinded to subject assignment.\nBlinding should be broken only in emergency situations for reasons of subject safety. Whenever possible, the investigator or sub-investigator consults with a member of the study team prior to breaking the blind. When the blinding code is broken, the reason must be fully documented and entered on the Case Record Form (CRF).\n\u2022 The investigator or medical designee is responsible for contacting the Pfizer Clinical Support Help Desk to obtain the Principal Investigator\u2019s user account information. The account information will only be given to the investigator or medical designee.\n\u2022 The investigator at each site will have the ability to break the blind on a subject in the electronic system.\nIn the event the investigator is not available to perform the break blind, the Pfizer Clinician, and the Pfizer Clinical Support Help Desk, also have the ability to break the blind and can inform the Principal Investigator subsequently.\n5.3. Compliance\nTanezumab and corresponding placebo dosing will be recorded on the appropriate CRF. Because tanezumab or corresponding placebo will be administered by site staff, subject compliance with SC treatment is not anticipated to be an issue.\nFor rescue medication (acetaminophen / paracetamol), compliance will be reviewed and reconciled at each study visit.\nProtocol rules governing the use of rescue medication are described in Section 5.8.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 45",

Investigational Product Storage\nThe Investigator or an approved representative (eg, Pharmacist) will ensure that all investigational products, including any marketed products, are stored in a secured area with controlled access under required storage conditions and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.\nInvestigational product should be stored in its original container and in accordance with the label. See the Pharmacy Manual for storage conditions of the product.\nStorage conditions stated in the single reference safety document (SRSD) (ie, Investigator\u2019s Brochure), will be superseded by the storage conditions stated in the investigational product labeling.\nSite systems must be capable of measuring and documenting (for example, via a log), at a minimum, daily minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations (as applicable, including frozen, refrigerated and/or room temperature products). This should be captured from the time of investigational product receipt throughout the study. Even for continuous monitoring systems, a log or site procedure that ensures active daily evaluation for excursions should be available. The operation of the temperature monitoring device and storage unit (for example, refrigerator), as applicable, should be regularly inspected to ensure it is maintained in working order.\nAny excursions from the product label storage conditions should be reported upon discovery. The site should actively pursue options for returning the product to the storage conditions as described in the labeling, as soon as possible. Deviations from the storage requirements, including any actions taken, must be documented and reported to the sponsor. Once an excursion is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined and not used until the sponsor provides documentation of permission to use the investigational product. It will not be considered a protocol deviation if the sponsor approves the use of the investigational product after the temperature excursion. Use of the investigational product prior to sponsor approval will be considered a protocol deviation.\nSpecific details regarding information the site should report for each excursion will be provided to the site.\n5.6. Investigational Product Accountability\nThe Investigative site must maintain adequate records documenting the receipt, use, loss, or other disposition of the drug supplies.\n5.6.1. Destruction of Investigational Product Supplies\nThe sponsor or designee will provide guidance on the destruction of unused investigational product (eg, at the site). If Pfizer authorizes destruction to take place at the trial site, the investigator must ensure that the materials are destroyed in compliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy, and any special instructions provided by Pfizer. Destruction must be adequately documented.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 47",

Prohibited Treatment(s)\nUse of analgesics (including marijuana and duloxetine) other than acetaminophen/ paracetamol is prohibited throughout Week 32 of the study beginning 48 hours prior to the start of the Initial Pain Assessment Period (the seven days prior to Randomization/Baseline) or at the period of time prior to the start of the Initial Pain Assessment Period that is \u22645 times the half-life of the particular analgesic used, whichever is greater. Refer to Appendix 3: Half-Lives of Prohibited Prior and Concomitant Medications, for a detailed washout schedule for prohibited medications. This is not an exhaustive list and Pfizer study management should be consulted for assistance if needed, in determining whether or not specific medications are permitted. Sites must consult product labeling and conduct a taper according to the product instructions if a taper is required.\nUse of prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) NSAIDs irrespective of route, eg oral, topical or rectal, (including COX-2 selective inhibitors) is also prohibited except in the following circumstances. Limited concomitant use of prescription or OTC NSAID may be allowed on an occasional basis for self-limiting conditions not related to osteoarthritis however, they may not be taken within 48 hours (or 5 half-lives, whichever is greater) of a study visit where efficacy assessments are being collected. The study monitor or Pfizer clinician should be contacted for approval prior to use whenever possible, and all doses and days of use will be recorded on the concomitant analgesic CRF. NSAID use should not exceed a total of 40 days between Day 1 (Baseline) and Week 32. Beginning at Week 32 (16-weeks after the last dose of study medication), subjects may use NSAIDs at their discretion.\nSubjects will be instructed that many over-the-counter medications contain NSAIDs and to guard against overuse. Subjects will be instructed to keep a recording of NSAID usage and amount. The number of days of NSAID use will be collected weekly via IRT from Baseline (Day 1) through the Week 48 visit. Additional information regarding NSAID use such as medication names, dosage and reason for use will be collected by the site on a CRF.\nNSAID usage will be monitored at 2 levels: the cumulative use from Baseline to Week 32 (a maximum of 40 days of use) and the aggregate days of use during each 8 week dosing interval (a maximum of 10 days of use).\nSubjects who exceed the allowable concomitant NSAID use limit of 40 days of use during the treatment phase of the study will be discontinued from the study and entered in the Early Termination Follow-up Period. Subjects taking greater than 10 days of aggregate use of NSAIDs per 8-week dosing interval (any dosage level of NSAIDs) should be interviewed by study site personnel to determine reason for use and if the subject anticipates being able to take NSAIDs according to protocol requirements in the future. The discussion should be noted in the patient\u2019s source documents. Subjects who indicate that they anticipate being able to take NSAIDs no more than 10 days per 8-week period going forward will be allowed to continue in the treatment period. However, if these subjects continue to take NSAIDs more than 10 days per 8-week period, they should be withdrawn from study treatment and entered into the Early Termination Follow-Up period (See Section 6.4).

Herbal, homeopathic, and naturopathic remedies should not be initiated during the study; however, subjects who have taken a stable dose of these products for at least 30 days prior to the Initial Pain Assessment Period will be allowed to continue their regimen. Subjects should be advised that St. John\u2019s Wort and other inducers of CYP3A4/5 such as carbamazepine and rifampin may interfere with the efficacy of hormonal contraceptive products. Biologics (for example: TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors such as adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab) other than study medication, and live attenuated vaccines must not have been taken within 3 months prior to the Initial Pain Assessment Period and are prohibited during the study. Flumist\u00ae Influenza Virus Vaccine Live, Intranasal or other inhaled influenza vaccines are the only exception of a live attenuated vaccine that will be permitted during the study.\n5.7.2. Permitted Treatments\nDaily low dose aspirin (\u2264325 mg or per local prescribing practice) therapy for cardiovascular prophylaxis is permitted without restriction.\nMedications for other (non-osteoarthritis, non-pain) conditions are permitted provided the subject has received a stable dose for at least 30 days before the IPAP (30 days prior to Screening for antihypertensive medications) and the dose is not expected to change during the study. Note however that dose adjustments (includes starting a new therapy) during the study can be made if required, and recorded on the concomitant medication CRF.\nOccasional use of pain medications for pain is permitted in situations such as outpatient diagnostic procedures (eg, colonoscopy, dental procedures) or limited accidental injury (eg, ankle sprains, minor fractures, minor burns/sunburns). Subjects should be counseled to avoid scheduling prospective procedures such that pain medications would be needed within 48 hours of a study visit (24 hours for acetaminophen/paracetamol).\nSubjects should be counseled to contact the assigned study monitor or study clinician for guidance/approval regarding the use of prohibited medications for other self-limiting conditions, accidental injury or other surgical procedures as the extent of the condition, injury or procedure and the resulting pain medication usage may require termination from the study. Any use of NSAID must be consistent with the allowed limit described in the Prohibited Medications Section 5.7.1.\nFor subjects who have discontinued investigational product, the investigator may prescribe standard of care treatment for subjects to take while completing the 24-week Safety Follow- up period once the last efficacy assessments have been obtained at the visit occurring\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 49",

In this study, standard of care treatment refers to analgesics approved by the relevant Health Authority to relieve the pain of osteoarthritis. These medications include opioids, topical analgesics, NSAIDs, capsaicin products, injectable corticosteroids and viscosupplementation (eg, hyaluronan) and are prescribed at the discretion of the Investigator. Pre-specified analgesics are not considered investigational product but will be reimbursed by Pfizer while the subject is participating in the 24-week Safety Follow-up period after at least 16 weeks have elapsed since their last dose of SC treatment was administered. Their use will be recorded on the concomitant medication CRF.\n5.8. Rescue Therapy\nAcetaminophen/paracetamol will be issued to the subject by the study sites in its approved marketed product dress (carton, bottle, documents) for use as rescue medication.\nDuring the Washout period and the Initial Pain Assessment Period, subjects may take rescue medication (acetaminophen/paracetamol) as needed for osteoarthritis or other types of pain or illness up to a maximum daily dose of 4000 mg/day, or as permitted by local or national labeling. Rescue medication must be discontinued at least 24 hours prior to the Baseline (Day 1) visit.\nIn the event of inadequate pain relief for osteoarthritis during the Double-blind Treatment period (between the Baseline [Day 1] visit and Week 24), subjects may take up to a maximum permitted daily dose of 4000 mg but only up to 5 days per week, or as permitted by local or national labeling.\nFrom the Baseline (Day 1) visit through Week 24, subjects taking rescue medication greater than 5 days per week (any level of acetaminophen/paracetamol used specifically for osteoarthritis pain) must be interviewed by study site personnel to determine if this is due to lack of efficacy or other reasons, and the discussion should be noted in the subject\u2019s source documents. Subjects who have taken rescue medication more frequently than specified in the protocol during the treatment period due to lack of efficacy and indicate that they cannot or will not follow the rescue medication protocol requirements because of insufficient osteoarthritis pain relief should be withdrawn from investigational product due to lack of efficacy and entered in the Early Termination Follow-up period (refer to Section 6.4). Subjects who indicate that they anticipate being able to take rescue medication no more than 5 days per week going forward will be allowed to continue in the treatment period. However, if these subjects continue to take rescue medication more than 5 days per week, they should be withdrawn from investigational product and entered into the Early Termination Follow-up period (refer to Section 6.4).\nBetween the Week 24 and Week 32 visits, subjects may take acetaminophen/paracetamol rescue medication daily, up to the maximum permitted dose of 4000 mg per day, or as permitted by local or national labeling.

STUDY PROCEDURES\nRefer to Schedule of Activities (Tables 1 and 2) for the lists of procedures to be performed throughout the study.\nIf possible, each subject\u2019s clinic visit should be conducted at approximately the same time of day throughout their participation in the study. As a general rule, scales/instruments should be completed first by the subject upon arrival at the clinic and vital signs should be assessed prior to blood draws at clinic visits.\nSubjects should be thoroughly instructed on completion of the scales/instruments via IRT prior to completing them the first time (eg at Screening for WOMAC Pain subscale and Numeric Pain Scale Rating; at Baseline for Patient Global Assessment (PGA) of Osteoarthritis, EQ-5D-5L, WPAI:OA, mPRTI questionnaires). No coaching or other interpretative assistance should be given to subjects during completion of these questionnaires.\nContinuing on from the Initial Pain Assessment Period, subjects will provide a daily assessment of their index joint pain through Week 24 via IRT (though these assessments could begin as early as at the Screening Visit).

On a weekly basis between Baseline and Week 48, subjects will record the number of days of concomitant NSAID use via IRT.\nStudy visit windows are \u00b13 days for Weeks 2 and 4, and \u00b17 days for Weeks 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44 and 48. Study visits should be scheduled with reference to the original baseline visit date as much as possible. Subject scheduling issues should be brought to the attention of the assigned study monitor or study clinician for resolution. Dosing visits should occur no earlier than 7 weeks from the previous injection. Visit window for the Week 48 (End of study) X-rays is +/-30 days from the nominal time point of the visit; however they should preferably be obtained prior to the Week 40 visit and, if possible, less than 14 days after the visit.\nSubjects will be reminded to abstain from taking rescue medication 24 hours prior to any study visit at which efficacy data is collected.\n6.1. Screening\nThe Screening period will consist of a maximum of 37 days prior to Randomization. Prior to entering the Initial Pain Assessment Period (IPAP; see Section 6.1.3), subjects taking prohibited medications must complete the required washout from these medications for at least 5 half-lives or 48 hours (whichever is greater). Screening procedures should be staged to minimize burden to the subject and to minimize conduct of procedures that may not be required if a subject is found to be ineligible.\nWritten informed consent will be obtained from each subject prior to any trial assessments. Each subject will be assessed as to his/her suitability per inclusion/exclusion criteria review.\nSubject demographics and the date of OA diagnosis for every affected joint will be obtained. A comprehensive medical history and concomitant medication review will be performed for each subject.\nHistory of insufficient pain relief from, inability to tolerate or contraindication to taking, acetaminophen/paracetamol, NSAID, and tramadol or opioid treatments will be clearly documented on the appropriate CRF page. The required level of evidence to establish that subjects meet this inclusion criterion will be based upon the investigator\u2019s judgment. Investigators should rely upon available medical records that he or she may already have access to, prescription medication records (eg, retail pharmacy records), records or information provided by referring physicians and/or subject historical recall if the investigator is satisfied with the level of detail subjects are able to provide on past medication use. Investigators should clearly document in source records the information used to establish whether a subject does or does not meet this inclusion criterion.

ASSESSMENTS\nEvery effort should be made to ensure that the protocol required tests and procedures are completed as described. However it is anticipated that from time to time there may be circumstances, outside of the control of the investigator, that may make it unfeasible to perform the test. In these cases the investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the safety and well-being of the subject. When a protocol required test cannot be performed the investigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions which he/she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible. The study team will be informed of these incidents in a timely fashion.\n7.1. Subject Diary Assessments\n7.1.1. Daily / Weekly Pain Assessments\nIf possible diary assessments of pain in the index joint and assessment of the major non- index joints will be completed by the subject at approximately the same time each day (or each week). Average pain will be assessed with an 11-point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) ranging from zero (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain) captured through IRT. The subjects should describe their pain in the index joint (and non-index joint when applicable) during the past 24 hours by choosing the appropriate number from 0 to 10. If possible, subjects should conduct the self-assessment in the evening.\nIndex Joint Pain Assessment\nAverage pain in the index joint will be assessed by the subject daily from the beginning of the IPAP to the Week 24 Visit, followed by weekly beginning after the Week 24 visit through Week 48 (and weekly during the Early Termination Follow-Up Period, if applicable).\n\u2022 Example question when the identified index joint is the right knee:\n\u201cSelect the number that best describes your average pain in your index joint, the right knee in the past 24 hours\u201d:\n2\n10\nNo\nPain\nWorst Possible Pain\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 64",

A major joint is defined as a mobile synovial joint in the limbs such as shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, ankles and excluding the joints of the toes and hands. If a subject responds that he/she has experienced new onset or increased pain in a non-index joint or other major joint (post-baseline), the subject will be asked to rate his/her pain in that joint on the same 11-point numeric rating scale shown above and will be asked to rate his/her pain in that joint for the remainder of the study.\n7.1.2. Rescue Medication and Amount\nRescue medication use will be collected daily via IRT from the beginning of the IPAP to the Week 24 Visit. The dosage strength of the acetaminophen/paracetamol tablets/caplets/capsules will be captured. The subject should note the number of tablets/caplets/capsules of rescue medication taken during the last 24 hours.\nFollowing the Week 24 visit up to the Week 48 visit and during the Early Termination Follow-Up Period for subjects who enter this phase of the study, the use of acetaminophen / paracetamol as rescue medication will be collected once weekly using IRT. The subject will record the number of days when rescue medication was used and maximum number of tablets, capsules or caplets of rescue medication taken on any day in the past week.\n7.1.3. Concomitant NSAID Use\nUse of over-the-counter or prescription NSAID will be collected weekly via IRT from the Baseline (Day 1) visit until the Week 48 visit. During the Early Termination Follow-Up Period for subjects who enter this phase of the study, the use of over-the-counter or prescription NSAID will be collected once weekly using IRT. Subjects will record the number of days of NSAID use in the past week using IRT. At telephone or clinic visits, sites will interview the subject regarding their NSAID use and record additional information on a CRF, such as the medication name, dosage and reason for use. The investigator or designee should closely monitor for concomitant NSAID use. Subjects reporting concomitant NSAID use will be managed per guidance provided in Section 5.7.1.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 65",

WOMAC Pain Subscale\nAt Screening and for the remainder of a subject\u2019s participation in the study, a WOMAC pain subscale questionnaire will only be completed for the index knee or hip.\nThe WOMAC Pain subscale is comprised of 5 questions regarding the amount of pain experienced due to osteoarthritis in the index joint (selected study knee or hip) in the past 48 hours. The WOMAC Pain subscale is calculated as the mean of the scores from the five individual questions, which may not be a whole (integer) number. The WOMAC Pain subscale NRS scores for each question, and the WOMAC Pain subscale score, range from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating higher pain.\n7.2.1.2. WOMAC Physical Function Subscale\nAt the Baseline (Day 1) visit and for the remainder of a subject\u2019s participation in the study, a WOMAC Physical Function subscale questionnaire will only be completed for the index knee or hip.\nThe WOMAC Physical Function subscale is comprised of 17 questions regarding the degree of difficulty experienced due to arthritis in the index joint (selected knee or hip) in the past 48 hours. The WOMAC Physical Function subscale is calculated as the mean of the scores from the seventeen individual questions, which may not be a whole (integer) number. The WOMAC Physical Function subscale NRS scores for each question, and the WOMAC Physical Function subscale score, range from 0 to 10 with higher scores indicating worse function. This refers to the subject's ability to move around and perform usual activities of daily living.\n7.2.1.3. WOMAC Stiffness Subscale\nAt the Baseline (Day 1) visit and for the remainder of a subject\u2019s participation in the study, a WOMAC Stiffness subscale questionnaire will only be completed for the index knee or hip.\nThe WOMAC Stiffness subscale is comprised of 2 questions regarding the amount of stiffness experienced in the index joint in the past 48 hours. The WOMAC Stiffness subscale is calculated as the mean of the scores from the two individual questions, which may not be a whole (integer) number. The WOMAC Stiffness subscale NRS scores for each question, and the WOMAC Stiffness subscale score, range from 0 to 10 with higher scores indicating more stiffness. Stiffness is defined as a sensation of decreased ease with which the subject moves the index knee or hip.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 66",

Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire - Osteoarthritis \u2013 Knee or Hip v2.0 (WPAI:OA)\nThe WPAI-OA Knee or Hip is a 6-item validated questionnaire that assesses the impact of osteoarthritis on absenteeism, presenteeism, work productivity, and activity impairment.20 Each subscale score is expressed as an impairment percentage (0-100) where higher numbers indicate greater impairment and less productivity. The WPAI-OA is self-administered by the subject and takes less than 5 minutes to complete (Appendix 6).\n7.2.4. EuroQol 5 Dimension (EQ-5D-5L)\nThe EQ-5D-5L\u2122 is a subject completed questionnaire designed to assess the subject\u2019s current health and translate that score into an index value or utility score. Health status is described in terms of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. There are two components to the EQ-5D-5L\u2122: a Health State Profile and a visual analog scale (VAS) item. The 5 item health state profile will be assessed to calculate a single index value (see Appendix 7). This instrument provides a mechanism for conducting cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses.21\n7.2.5. Patient Reported Treatment Impact Assessment-modified (mPRTI)\nThe mPRTI is a self-administered questionnaire containing four items to assess subject satisfaction, previous treatment, preference and willingness to continue using the investigational product. Higher scores indicate greater satisfaction, preference or willingness to use the investigational product; see Appendix 12. Subjects will record their responses\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 67",

Pregnancy Tests\nFor female subjects of childbearing potential, a serum or urine pregnancy test, with sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL, will be performed at screening, before investigational product administration at the baseline visit, and at the end of treatment visit. A negative pregnancy result is required before the subject may receive the investigational product. Pregnancy tests will also be done whenever 1 menstrual cycle is missed during the active treatment period (or when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected), and repeated at Visits 8, 16, at the end of the study to confirm the subject has not become pregnant during the study, and at Week 32 (16 weeks after the last dose of investigational product was administered). Pregnancy tests may also be repeated as per request of institutional review boards (IRBs)/ethics committees (ECs) or if required by local regulations.\nQualitative urine pregnancy tests must be sensitive to at least 25 mIU/mL. Qualitative point-of-service urine pregnancy tests will be conducted with the test kit provided by the central laboratory in accordance with instructions provided in its package insert. Subjects who have missed a menstrual period or who show an indeterminant or positive result on the qualitative point-of-service urine test may not further progress in the study until pregnancy is ruled out using further diagnostic testing (eg, a negative quantitative serum pregnancy test conducted at a certified laboratory).\nIn the case of a positive human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) test, the subject will be withdrawn from investigational product but may remain in the study.\nRefer to Sections 8.10 and 8.10.1 for guidance pertaining to exposure during pregnancy and post-natal follow-up.\n7.3.2.4. Serum FSH Testing\nFemale subjects of non-childbearing potential who have not had a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy and who have been amenorrheic at least 1 year with no alternative pathological or physiological cause must undergo serum FSH testing to determine post- menopausal status. A serum FSH level within the laboratory\u2019s reference range for post- menopausal females is required. Female subjects who have undergone documented total hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or who have medically confirmed ovarian failure are not of childbearing potential and do not require serum FSH testing.\nFemale subjects who have been amenorrheic less than 1 year will be considered of child- bearing potential.\nFemale subjects of childbearing potential do not require FSH testing.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 70",

Assessment of Pain in Major Joints at Screening with Numeric Pain Scale Rating (NRS)\nAverage pain in the major joints (shoulders, hips and knees) or any other painful, major joint that will be imaged at Screening, will be assessed by the subject at the Screening Visit with an 11-point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) ranging from zero (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain) and captured using IRT.\n7.3.4. Vital Signs\nVital signs (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate) will be collected and recorded throughout the study. Vital signs will be collected after the subject has been in a sitting position for at least five minutes at each noted visit.\n7.3.4.1. Orthostatic Blood Pressure Measurement\nIn addition to sitting vital sign measurements, orthostatic blood pressure measurements will be obtained using a standard manual sphygmomanometer. At each of these clinic visits, blood pressure will be assessed in supine and standing positions. Orthostatic blood pressure measurements will be obtained after collection of the sitting vital signs and before any required phlebotomy (and prior to dosing at dosing visits). To minimize chances of orthostatic hypotension related to volume depletion, subjects should be reminded to report for clinic visits well hydrated. In this regard, investigators could consider recommending to subjects that they consume 8 \u2013 16 ounces (240 \u2013 480 mL) of water prior to reporting to the clinic for study visits. All orthostatic blood pressure measurements will be recorded in the IRT system.\nSupine blood pressure measurement will be obtained after subjects have been in the supine position for a minimum of 10 minutes. To ensure that a stable supine blood pressure measurement is obtained, at least two systolic and diastolic measurements will be performed. If the replicate systolic and diastolic measurements differ by no more than 10 mmHg and 5 mmHg, respectively, the supine blood pressure will be considered to be stable. The mean of the two stable replicate measures will be considered to represent the baseline supine blood pressure (mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure) for that visit. Once the supine blood pressure is considered to be stable, subjects will be asked to assume the standing position. After subjects have been in the standing position for 1 minute and 3 minutes, systolic and diastolic blood pressure will be measured and recorded for both time points. If the measurements do not meet the criteria for orthostatic (postural) hypotension, no further measurements are needed. If either the 1 minute or 3 minute standing BP measurements show decreases meeting the criteria shown in Table 4, the sequence of supine and standing measurements should be repeated up to 2 more times. Refer to Table 4 for the criteria defining orthostatic hypotension and actions that should be taken when orthostatic hypotension criteria are met.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 71",

Refer to Section 7.4.3. for additional details pertaining to subject evaluation and further dosing with investigational product in subjects with sympathetic function adverse events.\n7.3.6. Survey of Autonomic Symptoms (SAS)\nThe Survey of Autonomic Symptoms (SAS)22 is a validated, easily administered instrument to measure autonomic symptoms that has been proposed to be valuable in assessing neuropathic autonomic symptoms in clinical trials (refer to Appendix 11).\nSubjects will complete the SAS at Screening and Week 24 (or at Early Termination Visits 1 and 3, as described in Section 6.4.). Subjects will enter responses in IRT.\n7.3.7. Radiographic Assessments\nScheduled X-rays of each shoulder, hip and knee will be obtained at Screening and at Weeks 24 and 48 (or at Early Termination, as described in Section 6.4.) visits.\nRadiographic assessments of other major joints exhibiting signs or symptoms suggestive of osteoarthritis should also be imaged. A major joint is defined as a mobile synovial joint in the limbs such as shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, ankles and excluding the joints of the toes and hands. Any joint imaged at Screening or other at-risk joints identified during the study period should also be imaged at Week 24 and 48 (or at Early Termination Visit 3, as described in Section 6.4.) visits.\nNOTE: It is recommended that the radiographs required at Screening be obtained as soon as possible after the Screening visit to permit central radiology review of the images for determination of subject radiographic eligibility for initial dosing in the study. Subjects will not be permitted to start dosing in the study until the Screening radiographs are reviewed by the Central Reader and eligibility is established. X-rays required for the Week 24 visit may be conducted within 30 days of the visit (ie, before or after the visit). X-rays for the Week 48 visit may be conducted up to 30 days before and, preferably, no more than 14 days after the visit.\nFor subjects who are discontinued prior to the Week 48 visit, follow-up radiographs of each shoulder, hip and knee (and any other major joint imaged at Screening or other at risk joints identified during the study period) should be performed as soon as possible (refer to Section 6.4) after the decision to withdraw from the study has been made, provided at least 30 days have passed since the last set of X-rays were collected. A final set of follow-up radiographs of each knee, hip and shoulder (and any other major joint imaged at Screening or other at risk joints identified during the study period) should be obtained 24 weeks (Early Termination Visit 3, Section 6.4.1.4) after the last dose of SC investigational product was administered.\nThe X-ray technologists, in addition to their professional training and certifications, will be trained in performing the radiographic protocols for the knees, hips, and shoulders for this study and given approval by Pfizer or its representative to perform study X-rays.

Additional details regarding the required X-rays will be provided in a site imaging manual.\nCentral radiology readers (Central Readers) will be board certified radiologists or have the international equivalent as musculoskeletal radiologists. The Central Readers will be governed by an imaging atlas and an imaging Charter which includes a specific description of the scope of their responsibilities. Central Readers will review radiology images at Screening for assessment of eligibility (including determination of Kellgren-Lawrence Grade) and identification of exclusionary joint conditions such as rapidly progressive osteoarthritis, atrophic or hypotrophic osteoarthritis, subchondral insufficiency fractures (spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee [SPONK]), primary osteonecrosis and pathological fractures. After randomization, Central Readers will review radiology images for diagnosis of joint conditions that would warrant further evaluation by the Adjudication Committee such as possible or probable rapidly progressive osteoarthritis, subchondral insufficiency fractures (spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee [SPONK]), primary osteonecrosis or pathological fracture and subjects undergoing total joint replacement for any reason, all images and other source documentation will be provided to the blinded tanezumab Adjudication Committee for review and adjudication of the event. The Adjudication Committee\u2019s assessment of the event will represent the final classification of the event.\n7.3.7.1. Radiation Exposure\nThe International Commission on Radiation Protection (ICRP) has developed and applied the As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) principle in developing guidelines that balance the benefits of radiation exposures against possible risks. This principle states that human exposures to radiation should be \u201cAs Low As Reasonably Achievable, with economic and social considerations taken into account.\u201d\nWithin the context of medical and research exposures, this is usually taken to mean that each individual should receive no more radiation than is necessary to obtain reliable information and that no more research participants should be irradiated than is necessary to answer a particular scientific question.\nRadiograph Annual Effective dose (mSv) Knee23 0.036 mSv Hip24,25 2.6 mSv Shoulder24 0.06 mSv TOTAL 2.696 mSv\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 74",

In some cases, it is expected that a repeat image of a joint may be necessary due to the quality of the X-ray images.\n7.3.8. Neurologic Examination\nNeurologic examinations will be performed by a designated physician and assessed for clinically significant changes from Baseline. The examinations will be performed at Screening, Baseline (Day 1), and Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32 and 48 (or at each Early Termination Visit, as described in Section 6.4. and Table 2) and the Neuropathy Impairment Score (NIS) will be completed at these time points based on this neurological exam (refer to Appendix 8). Neurologic examination will assess strength of groups of muscles of the head and neck, upper limbs and lower limbs, deep tendon reflexes and sensation (tactile, vibration, joint position sense and pin prick) of index fingers and great toes in order to complete the NIS. The NIS is a standardized instrument which has been tested in both healthy subjects and subjects with neuropathy and which has been used to evaluate subjects for signs of peripheral neuropathy in clinical trials.27 Investigators and other designated physicians performing the neurologic evaluations are required to attend a training session for neurological exam in order to apply consistency across sites. The neurological exams must be performed in a controlled and consistent manner and by the same examiner when possible.\nA neurologic evaluation should be performed by a consulting neurologist if any of the following occurs:\nL]\nIf an adverse event suggestive of new or worsening peripheral neuropathy or an adverse event of abnormal peripheral sensation (eg, allodynia, burning sensation, carpal tunnel syndrome, dysesthesia, hyperesthesia, hyperpathia, hypoesthesia, neuralgia, neuritis, neuropathy peripheral, pallanesthesia, paresthesia, peripheral sensory neuropathy, sciatica, sensory disturbance, sensory loss, tarsal tunnel syndrome) is reported as: 1) a serious adverse event or 2) an adverse event which has resulted in the subject being withdrawn from the study, or 3) an adverse event ongoing at the end of the subject\u2019s participation in the study, or 4) an adverse event of severe intensity.\n\u2022 A new or worsened clinically significant abnormality on the neurologic exam should be reported as an adverse event and may result in a neurologic evaluation/consult further to the guidance above.\n\u2022 A neurological adverse event which is non-neuropathic (eg, stroke, seizure) but which the investigator considers medically important should also result in a neurological consultation.\nIn these cases, a neurologic evaluation should be obtained as soon as possible after these signs and symptoms are known. The results of the neurological consultation will be recorded on the appropriate CRF and adverse event (if applicable) forms. Adverse events will be reported where applicable as described in Section 8.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 75",

If the dysesthesia/allodynia has not resolved within the 14-day period after the scheduled dosing date, the subject will not receive any additional doses of investigational product and will enter the Early Termination Follow-up period (refer to Section 6.4).\n7.4.2. Hypersensitivity or Injection Site Reactions\nIf a severe hypersensitivity reaction or severe injection reaction occurs following any administration of SC investigational product, the investigational product should be discontinued immediately and no further administrations of SC investigational product will be allowed. Subjects experiencing these types of reactions will enter the Early Termination Follow-up period (refer to Section 6.4).\nSevere hypersensitivity reactions are defined as those causing anaphylaxis. Severe injection site reactions are defined as those in which ulceration or severe necrosis occurs.\n7.4.3. Orthostatic Hypotension and Sympathetic Function Adverse Events\nBlood pressure changes meeting the pre-specified criteria for orthostatic hypotension and confirmed as described in Section 7.3.4.1 will be designated as confirmed orthostatic hypotension episode and should be reported as an adverse event whether or not the subject had accompanying symptoms.\nConfirmed episodes of orthostatic hypotension: If a confirmed episode of orthostatic hypotension occurs (as defined in Section 7.3.4.1) it should be reported as an adverse event and the subject should be further evaluated as described below to determine if a neurology or cardiology consultation should be obtained and/or whether further treatment with\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 76",

See \u201cSympathetic function adverse events\u201d below for decisions regarding subject management and continued dosing with investigational product.\n2. If an apparent medical cause is identified at the time the orthostatic hypotension criterion is met or if the subject is asymptomatic, the subject should have a repeat assessment of orthostatic hypotension performed at least 1 week later but not more than 4 weeks later. During this time the investigator should attempt to address the underlying medical cause of the orthostatic hypotension. If confirmed orthostatic hypotension (as defined in Section 7.3.4.1) is present at the follow-up visit, the subject should be further evaluated for the presence of sympathetic autonomic neuropathy by a cardiologist or neurologist as soon as possible. See \u201cSympathetic function adverse events\u201d below for decisions regarding subject management and repeat dosing.\nSympathetic function adverse events: Subjects reporting adverse events (any seriousness or severity) with preferred terms of bradycardia (see Section 7.3.5 for ECG criteria for bradycardia), syncope, orthostatic hypotension (as described above and in boxes C and E of flow diagram, Figure 2, anhidrosis or hypohidrosis should be further evaluated for the presence of sympathetic autonomic neuropathy by a cardiologist or neurologist as soon as possible.\nThe investigator should determine the appropriate type of consultation (neurology or cardiology) depending on the subject\u2019s symptom presentation and the investigator\u2019s assessment as to the specialist best able to evaluate the subject. Pfizer will provide a guidance document which outlines appropriate recommendations regarding tests to consider for subject work-up.\nThese subjects should not be dosed with SC investigational product until the absence of sympathetic autonomic neuropathy has been confirmed. Subjects who are not deemed to have a sympathetic autonomic neuropathy based on this evaluation can continue the study provided no more than 12 weeks have elapsed since the last dose of SC treatment (Boxes H and K of flow diagram, Figure 2). However, if the subject is still symptomatic with bradycardia, syncope, orthostatic hypotension, anhidrosis or hypohidrosis up to 12 weeks after the last dose of SC treatment, s/he should not receive additional investigational product, even if a sympathetic autonomic neuropathy has not been confirmed (Boxes J and L of flow diagram, Figure 2), and will enter the Early Termination Follow up period (refer to Section 6.4). Subjects found to have a sympathetic autonomic neuropathy (Boxes I and L of flow diagram, Figure 2) should not receive additional investigational product and will enter the Early Termination Follow up period (refer to Section 6.4).\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 77",

In addition, on a weekly basis beginning at the Initial Pain Assessment Period and through Week 48 of the study, the subject will also be asked if he/she experienced new onset or increased pain in a major non-index joint (refer to Section 7.1.1). If a subject responds that he/she has experienced new onset or increased pain in a non-index joint or other major joint (post-baseline), the subject will be asked to rate his/her pain in that joint on the same 11-point numeric rating scale, using a 24-hour recall (refer to Section 7.1.1) and will be asked to rate his/her pain in that joint for the remainder of the study.\nJoint pain scores recorded electronically will be monitored by site staff to identify subjects who have a pattern of severe pain over several days or a rapid increase in pain. Subjects who record increased pain scores of severe intensity (eg, a score of 7-10 out of 10 on a numerical rating scale) in a knee, hip, shoulder or other major joint which is persistent for at least 2 weeks despite treatment with analgesic medication should be evaluated radiographically. An earlier evaluation of the subject can be made at the discretion of the investigator.\nAt each study visit, systematic site review of the WOMAC Pain Scores, electronically recorded pain scores, and relevant spontaneously reported adverse events will be implemented. In addition, adverse events of joint pain, joint swelling, joint injury/accidents, fractures or worsening of osteoarthritis symptoms in index or non-index joints will be evaluated by the site personnel. An assessment of the subjects\u2019 general health and major joints for any changes in their osteoarthritis status will be carried out.\nMusculoskeletal physical exam findings, review of reported musculoskeletal adverse events, and in-clinic efficacy assessments will be recorded on specific case report forms for each study visit.\nSubjects meeting the criteria for increased severe or persistent pain or with other clinically significant findings based on the assessment of the Investigator are considered to have a joint(s) at risk and must have radiographs (X-rays) of the joint(s) obtained and sent to the Central Reader for assessment. MRI scans will not be required but may be obtained if warranted for diagnostic purposes. If warranted, the subject will be referred to an orthopedic surgeon for evaluation.\nRadiographic (and any MRI) images collected as part of follow-up procedures for reports of increased severe or persistent pain or clinically significant findings of the investigator will be assessed by the Central Reader for possible or probable events of rapidly progressive osteoarthritis, subchondral insufficiency fractures (spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee [SPONK]), primary osteonecrosis, or pathological fracture (refer to Section 7.4.5 and Section 9.5).\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 79",

Central Reader and Subject-Level Stopping Criteria for Joint Safety Events\nSubjects identified through the measures described above (in Section 7.4.4) who are determined by the Central Reader to have a possible or probable joint safety event (rapidly progressive osteoarthritis (type-1 or type-2), subchondral insufficiency fractures (spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee [SPONK]), primary osteonecrosis, or pathological fracture), will be withdrawn from treatment and enter the Early Termination Follow-up period (refer to Section 6.4).\nThe Central Reader will review the radiology images on an ongoing basis and provide assessments to the investigator and Pfizer. For subjects who are identified with a possible or probable joint safety event described above and for subjects undergoing total joint replacement for any reason, all images and other source documentation will be provided to the blinded tanezumab Adjudication Committee for review and adjudication of the event. The Adjudication Committee\u2019s assessment of the event will represent the final classification of the event (refer to Appendix 10).\nSubjects with adverse event reports of rapidly progressive osteoarthritis (type-1 or type-2), subchondral insufficiency fractures (spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee [SPONK]), primary osteonecrosis, or pathological fracture, will be withdrawn from treatment and enter the Early Termination Follow-up period (refer to Section 6.4).\nIn addition to Subject-Level Stopping Criteria for Joint Safety Events, this study will also employ Protocol-Level Stopping Criteria. Protocol-Level Stopping Criteria for Joint Safety Events are described in Section 9.6.2.\n7.4.6. Procedures for Subjects Undergoing Joint Replacement\nSubjects who have undergone or plan to undergo total joint replacement or other arthroplasty procedure during the study will be discontinued from investigational product. Follow-up procedures for these subjects are described in Section 6.4.2 In addition, subjects who undergo total knee, hip or shoulder joint replacement surgery during the study (Treatment Period or Follow-up Period) will be followed for 24 weeks after the procedure as part of a separate protocol, provided the subject consents.\n7.5. Pharmacokinetic (PK) and Pharmacodynamic (PD)\n7.5.1. Plasma for Analysis of Tanezumab\nBlood samples for the assessment of the pharmacokinetics of tanezumab will collected and will be analyzed using a validated analytical method in compliance with Pfizer standard operating procedures.\nSamples may be used for further evaluation of the bioanalytical method. These data will be used for internal exploratory purposes and will not be included in the clinical report.\nThe shipment address and assay lab contact information will be provided to the investigator site prior to initiation of the trial.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 80",

Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) for Pharmacodynamic Analyses\nBlood samples will be collected for the assessment of NGF. NGF can exist in different forms including but not limited to NGF bound to drug or not bound to drug, NGF bound to soluble p75, and proNGF. Blood volume collected will limit the number of NGF assessment to 3 to 4 NGF endpoints including a measure of total NGF (sum of all NGF forms). The final set of NGF forms that will be measured will depend on the availability of the analytical assay that can reliably measure the NGF concentration.\nNGF samples will be collected at Baseline (Day 1; predose) and Week 8 (predose), Week 24 (predose), Week 32 and Week 48 (or at Early Termination Visits 1 & 2, as described in Section 6.4).\nInstructions regarding sample processing (eg, sample volumes, tube types, storage temperatures) will be provided in the laboratory manual.\nSamples will be analyzed using a validated analytical method in compliance with Pfizer standard operating procedures.\nNGF samples may be used for further evaluation of the bioanalytical methods used for measuring NGF.

Biomarkers\n7.6.1. Serum Biomarkers\nBlood samples for the assessment of biomarkers that can be modulated by the osteoarthritis condition will be collected.\nIf possible, the samples should be obtained at approximately the same time at each study visit to control for diurnal variations in the biomarkers and following a fasting period of at least 8 hours. Fasting status should be recorded on the eCRF.\nCurrently measurement of 12 biomarkers are planned:   CCI   This selection of biomarkers could change due to blood  \nvolume limitations and/or assay performance issues. Possibly OA biomarkers different from the ones listed could be added or substituted if considered informative to further understand the osteoarthritis condition.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 81",

Banked Biospecimens\n7.7.1. Markers of Drug Response\nStudying the variation in genetic markers and other biomarkers may help to explain some of the variability in response seen with some drugs among different individuals. This is referred to as pharmacogenomic/biomarker research. Comparing the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), RNA (ribonucleic acid), protein, and metabolite variation patterns of subjects who respond well and those who respond poorly to treatment may help to better define the most appropriate group of subjects in which to target a given treatment. Collecting biospecimens for exploratory pharmacogenomic/biomarker analyses and retaining them in the Pfizer BioBank makes it possible to better understand the drug\u2019s mechanism of action and to seek explanations for differences in, for example, exposure, efficacy, tolerability, or safety not anticipated prior to the beginning of the study.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 82",

Samples will be kept in a facility accessible only by swiping a badge. Data will be stored on password-protected computer systems. The key between the code and the subject\u2019s personal identifiers will be held at the study site; the researchers using the biospecimens and data generated from them will not have access to the key nor any personally identifying information. Biospecimens will be used only for the purposes described here and in the informed consent document/subject information sheet; any other uses require additional ethical approval. Unless a time limitation is required by local regulations or ethical requirements, biospecimens will be stored indefinitely to allow for future research on the topics described here, including research conducted during the lengthy drug development process and also post-marketing research. Subjects can withdraw their consent for the use of their biospecimens at any time by making a request to the investigator, in which event any remaining biospecimen will be destroyed; data already generated from the biospecimens will continue to be stored to protect the integrity of existing analyses. It is very unlikely that results generated from the biospecimens will have any clinical, diagnostic, or therapeutic implications for the individual study participants. Subjects are notified in the informed consent document/subject information sheet that their results will not be given to them, unless required by local laws or regulations, in which case results will be returned via the investigator. Results will not be provided to family members or other physicians; nor will they be recorded in the subject\u2019s medical record. There is no intention to contact subjects after completion of the clinical study.\nA 4 mL blood biospecimen Prep D1 (K2 EDTA whole blood collection optimized for DNA analysis) will be collected at the Baseline (Day 1) visit to be retained for potential pharmacogenomic/biomarker analyses related to drug response, unless prohibited by local regulations or ethics committee decision. For example, putative safety biomarkers, drug metabolizing enzyme genes, drug transport protein genes, or genes thought to be related to the mechanism of drug action may be examined.\nThe Banked Biospecimens will be collected from all subjects unless prohibited by local regulations or ethics committee decision. Detailed collection, processing, storage and shipment instructions are provided in the central laboratory manual.\nIt is possible that the use of these biospecimens may result in commercially viable products. Subjects will be advised in the informed consent document/subject information sheet that they will not be compensated in this event.\n7.7.2.

Subjects may still participate in the clinical trial if they elect not to allow their banked biospecimens to be used for the additional purposes described in this section.\n8. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING\n8.1. Adverse Events\nAll observed or volunteered adverse events (AEs) regardless of treatment group or suspected causal relationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following sections.\nFor all AEs, the investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine the outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) requiring immediate notification to Pfizer or its designated representative. For all AEs, sufficient information should be obtained by the investigator to determine the causality of the AE. The investigator is required to assess causality. Follow- up by the investigator may be required until the event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment.\nAs part of ongoing safety reviews conducted by the Sponsor, any non-serious adverse event that is determined by the Sponsor to be serious will be reported by the Sponsor as an SAE. To assist in the determination of case seriousness further information may be requested from the investigator to provide clarity and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical study.\n8.2. Reporting Period\nFor SAEs, the active reporting period to Pfizer or its designated representative begins from the time that the subject provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the subject\u2019s participation in the study, ie, prior to undergoing any study-related procedure and/or receiving investigational product, through the end of the safety Follow-up period or through and including 112 calendar days after the subject\u2019s last administration of the subcutaneous investigational medication if the subject refuses the protocol defined Follow-up period.\nSerious adverse events occurring to a subject after the active reporting period has ended should be reported to the Sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to investigational product are to be reported to the Sponsor.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 84",

Definition of an Adverse Event\nAn AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a product or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment or usage. Examples of AEs include but are not limited to:\n\u2022 Abnormal test findings;\n\u2022 Clinically significant symptoms and signs;\n\u2022 Changes in physical examination findings;\n\u2022 Hypersensitivity;\n\u2022 Progression/worsening of underlying disease;\n\u2022 Drug abuse;\n\u2022 Drug dependency.\nAdditionally, they may include the signs or symptoms resulting from:\n\u2022 Drug overdose;\n\u2022 Drug withdrawal;\n\u2022 Drug misuse;\n\u2022 Drug interactions;\n\u2022 Extravasation;\n\u2022 Exposure during pregnancy (EPD);\n\u2022 Exposure via breastfeeding;\n\u2022 Medication error;\n\u2022 Occupational exposure.\n8.4.

Abnormal Test Findings\nThe criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as an AE are as follows:\n\u2022 Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms, and/or\n\u2022 Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention, and/or\n\u2022 Test result leads to a change in study dosing or discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therapy, and/or\n\u2022 Test result is considered to be an AE by the investigator or sponsor.\nMerely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not constitute an AE. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an AE.\n8.6. Serious Adverse Events\nA Serious Adverse Event is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that:\n\u2022 Results in death;\nIs life-threatening (immediate risk of death);\n\u2022 Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;\n\u2022 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions);\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 86",

An important medical event may not be immediately life-threatening and/or result in death or hospitalization. However, if it is determined that the event may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other AE outcomes, the important medical event should be reported as serious.\nExamples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.\nMedical device complaints may meet the SAE reporting requirement criteria (see Section 8.14.3 on Medical Device Complaint Reporting Requirements). An incident is any malfunction (ie, the failure of a device to meet its performance specifications or to perform as intended; performance specifications include all claims made in the labeling for the device) that, directly or indirectly, might lead to or might have led to the death of a subject, or user, or of other persons, or to a serious deterioration in their state of health.\nA serious injury that can cause a serious deterioration in state of health can include:\na life-threatening illness, even if temporary in nature;\na permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure;\na condition necessitating medical or surgical intervention to prevent the above 2 bulleted items;\n\u2022 Examples: clinically relevant increase in the duration of a surgical procedure, a condition that requires hospitalization or significant prolongation of existing hospitalization;\nany indirect harm as a consequence of an incorrect diagnostic or in vitro diagnostic device test results when used within the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for use;\nfetal distress, fetal death, or any congenital abnormality or birth defects.\n8.6.1.

This evaluation should include laboratory tests, detailed history and physical assessment. In addition to repeating measurements of AST and ALT, laboratory tests should include albumin, creatine kinase, total bilirubin, direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma-glutamyl transferase, prothrombin time (PT)/ international normalized ratio (INR), and alkaline phosphatase. A detailed history, including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen/paracetamol, recreational drug and supplement consumption, family history, occupational exposure, sexual history, travel history, history of contact with a jaundiced person, surgery, blood transfusion, history of liver or allergic disease, and work exposure, should be collected. Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, or C infection and liver imaging (eg, biliary tract) may be warranted. All cases confirmed on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory criteria defined above, with no other cause for liver function test (LFT) abnormalities identified at the time should be considered potential Hy\u2019s law cases irrespective of availability of all the results of the investigations performed to determine etiology of the abnormal LFTs.

Severity Assessment\nIf required on the AE case report forms (CRFs), the investigator will use the adjectives MILD, MODERATE, or SEVERE to describe the maximum intensity of the AE. For purposes of consistency, these intensity grades are defined as follows: MILD Does not interfere with subject's usual function. MODERATE Interferes to some extent with subject's usual function. SEVERE Interferes significantly with subject's usual function.\n) T M G ( 1 2 : 7 1 6 1 0 2 - b e F - 0 1 : n O d e v o r p p A \\ d e v o r p p A \\ 6 9 c 4 1 b 7 8 1 e 7 7 1 0 9\n0\nNote the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an AE. A severe event is not necessarily an SAE. For example, a headache may be severe (interferes significantly with subject's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the criteria for SAEs, listed above.\n8.9. Causality Assessment\nThe investigator\u2019s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and non- serious); the investigator must record the causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting requirements if applicable. An investigator\u2019s causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an AE; generally the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be provided. If the investigator does not know whether or not the investigational product caused the event, then the event will be handled as \u201crelated to investigational product\u201d for reporting purposes, as defined by the Sponsor (refer to Section 8.14. Reporting Requirements). If the investigator's causality assessment is \"unknown but not related to investigational product\", this should be clearly documented on study records.\nIn addition, if the investigator determines that an SAE is associated with study procedures, the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements, if applicable.\n8.10. Exposure During Pregnancy\nFor both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during pregnancy occurs if:\n1. A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational product; or the female becomes, or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or being exposed to the investigational product;\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 90",

An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact with a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic products).\n3. A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed during his partner\u2019s pregnancy.\nIf a study subject or study subject\u2019s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the study subject\u2019s treatment with the investigational product, the investigator must submit this information to the Pfizer Drug Safety Unit on an SAE report form and an Exposure During Pregnancy (EDP) Supplemental Form, regardless of whether an SAE has occurred. In addition, the investigator must submit information regarding environmental exposure to a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a subject reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cytotoxic product by inhalation or spillage) using the EDP Supplemental Form. This must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure. The information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy).\nFollow-up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy and its outcome for all EDP reports with an unknown outcome. The investigator will follow the pregnancy until completion or until pregnancy termination and notify Pfizer of the outcome as a follow up to the initial EDP Supplemental Form. In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth. In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the terminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless pre-procedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the findings are reported).\nIf the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [in a live born baby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.\nAdditional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported as SAEs follows:\n\u2022 Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion.\n\u2022 Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard to causality, as SAEs. In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be reported as serious adverse events when the investigator assesses the infant death as related or possibly related to exposure to the investigational product.\nAdditional information regarding the EDP may be requested by the investigator. Further follow-up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case-by-case basis (eg, follow-up on preterm infants to identify developmental delays). In the case of paternal exposure, the investigator will provide the study subject with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to deliver to his partner.

Additional Postnatal Development Follow-up\nThe Investigator will be asked to assist with collection of assessments of postnatal development as part of a separate protocol. Participation in that protocol is optional and will require that the subject review, agree and sign a separate informed consent document specific to that study, explaining the details of the post-partum follow-up for the subject and the newborn to participate in these assessments of postnatal development.\n8.11. Occupational Exposure\nAn occupational exposure occurs when during the performance of job duties, a person (whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact with the product, which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an AE.\nAn occupational exposure is reported to the drug safety unit within 24 hours of the investigator\u2019s awareness, using the SAE Report form, regardless of whether there is an associated AE/SAE. Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study, the information is not reported on a CRF, however a copy of the completed SAE report form is maintained in the investigator site file.\n8.12. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events (See Also Section 6.4. Subject Withdrawal)\nWithdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes according to the definition of AE noted earlier, and recorded on the appropriate AE CRF page.\nWhen a subject withdraws because of an SAE, the SAE must be reported in accordance with the reporting requirements defined below.\n8.13. Eliciting Adverse Event Information\nThe investigator is to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by the study subject or legally acceptable representative. In addition, each study subject or legally acceptable representative will be questioned about AEs.\n8.14. Reporting Requirements\nEach AE is to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for SAEs. If an SAE occurs, expedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate.\n8.14.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements\nIf an SAE occurs, Pfizer is to be notified within 24 hours of investigator awareness of the event.\nIn particular, if the SAE is fatal or life-threatening, notification to Pfizer must be made immediately, irrespective of the extent of available AE information.

In addition, an investigator may be requested by Pfizer to obtain specific additional follow-up information in an expedited fashion. This information collected for SAEs is more detailed than that captured on the AE CRF. In general, this will include a description of the AE in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of possible causality. Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant medications vaccines and/or illnesses must be provided. In the case of a subject death, a summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Pfizer or its designated representative.\n8.14.2. Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements\nAll AEs will be reported on the AE page(s) of the CRF. It should be noted that the form for collection of SAE information is not the same as the AE CRF. Where the same data are collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner. For example, the same AE term should be used on both forms. AEs should be reported using concise medical terminology on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of SAE information.\n8.14.3. Medical Device Reporting Requirements\nAll medical device complaints, regardless of whether the medical device complaint is associated with an AE, will be collected on the applicable pages within the CRF. This includes potential incidents or malfunctions associated with the use of a medical device product. An incident or malfunction is an event that might have led to death or serious deterioration in health, or if it occurred again might have led to death or serious deterioration in health.\nPfizer is to be notified of all medical device complaints within 24 hours of the investigator\u2019s awareness of the event.\nRefer to the Pharmacy Manual for procedures for forwarding medical device complaints not associated with an SAE to Pfizer.\n8.14.4.

DATA ANALYSIS/STATISTICAL METHODS\nDetailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this study will be documented in a Statistical Analysis Plan, which will be maintained by the sponsor. This document may modify the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any major modifications of the primary endpoint definition and/or its analysis will also be reflected in a protocol amendment.\n9.1. Sample Size Determination\nA sample size of 270 subjects per treatment group is needed to provide approximately 80% power to achieve statistical significance (at the 5% two-sided level) for the two comparisons of tanezumab 2.5 and 5 mg SC versus placebo, over all three co-primary endpoints. The total sample size will be approximately 810 subjects.\nThe assumed treatment differences for this calculation come from a combined analysis of Studies A4091011 and A4091014, using an ANCOVA model for the change from Baseline to Week 24 for each of the 3 co-primary endpoints. Imputation for missing data used mixed Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) and Baseline Observation Carried Forward (BOCF) matching the reasons for the primary analysis described below in Section 9.2.1. Under this model the difference between tanezumab 2.5 & 5 mg versus placebo were approximately -0.75/-0.77 & -1.01/-1.05 for WOMAC Pain/Physical Function subscales, and -0.25 & -0.34 for the Patient\u2019s Global Assessment of Osteoarthritis. The within-group standard deviations were 2.76, 2.63 and 0.94 for WOMAC Pain, WOMAC Physical Function and Patient\u2019s Global Assessment of Osteoarthritis, respectively. The correlation of the change from Baseline to Week 24 value for WOMAC Pain versus Physical Function was 0.92. The correlations between Patient\u2019s Global Assessment of Osteoarthritis and WOMAC Pain and Physical Function were approximately 0.67.\nUsing the treatment differences, variability and correlations given above, the sample size of 270 subjects per group would give 80% power to show significant treatment differences using the two-sided 5% significance, for the two tanezumab versus placebo comparisons over all three co-primary efficacy endpoints.\n9.2. Efficacy Analysis\n9.2.1. Analysis of Primary Endpoint\nThe primary efficacy population will be the intent to treat (ITT) population, defined as all randomized subjects who received SC investigational product (either tanezumab or matching placebo). The primary analysis will use multiple imputation methods for missing data at Week 24. Details of the multiple imputation procedure are given below. All treatment comparisons will use the two-sided 5% significance level.\nThe co-primary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using an ANCOVA model, with model terms for Baseline score, Baseline diary average pain, index joint (knee or hip), highest Kellgren-Lawrence grade, and treatment group, and study site as a random effect. The assessment of significance for the tanezumab SC versus placebo treatment contrasts will use a step-down testing strategy within each of the co-primary efficacy endpoints defined as first\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 94",

Finally, a tanezumab treatment group is declared as superior to placebo if the corresponding treatment contrast is significant over all three co- primary endpoints. This testing procedure will maintain the Type I error to 5% or less within each of the co-primary efficacy endpoints, and to less than 5% for all three co-primary efficacy endpoints. An additional (main effects ANCOVA) analysis for each of the co- primary efficacy endpoints will use a per-protocol analysis set, which will exclude subjects who are major protocol deviators.\nThe primary analysis of the co-primary endpoints will use multiple imputation for missing data, to account for uncertainty around the subject response. The basis for imputing missing values will be dependent on the reasons for missing data. For subjects with missing data due to discontinuation prior to Week 24 for lack of efficacy or for an adverse event or death, imputation will be based on sampling from a normal distribution using a mean value equal to the subject\u2019s Baseline efficacy value and the standard deviation (over all treatment groups) of the observed efficacy data at Week 24. For subjects with missing data for any other reason, imputation will be based on sampling from a normal distribution using a mean value equal to the subject\u2019s last observed efficacy value and standard deviation (over all treatment groups) of the observed efficacy data at Week 24. Imputed values for the Patient\u2019s Global Assessment of Osteoarthritis will be rounded to integer values from 1 to 5. Imputed values for WOMAC Pain and Physical Function will be truncated at 0 and 10. One hundred imputation samples will be used, and the ANCOVA model described above will be used for each imputation dataset. The final results will be calculated using the combined sets of results from each imputation dataset analysis.2\nAdditional analyses will explore the sensitivity of results to the effect of missing data on the co-primary efficacy endpoints. The first analysis will use the same main effects ANCOVA model as described above, but with LOCF for missing data. The second analysis will use the same main effects ANCOVA model as described above, but with BOCF for missing data. The third analysis will use Mixed Model for Repeated Measurements (MMRM) utilizing all observed data up to and including Week 24.\n9.2.2. Analysis of Secondary Endpoints\nSecondary efficacy endpoints will examine the change from Baseline to additional timepoints in the WOMAC Pain and Physical Function subscales, and the Patient\u2019s Global Assessment of Osteoarthritis, using the multiple imputation for missing data procedure and analysis described above. The change from Baseline in the Patient\u2019s Global Assessment of Osteoarthritis to Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12,16, 24 and 32 will also be analyzed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test (stratified by the combinations of the two stratification factors). Changes by each level of improvement will be summarized. For this analysis imputation for missing data will used mixed BOCF/LOCF, as well as BOCF and LOCF separately.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 95",

In addition, in order to closely match the primary imputation analysis, a mixed BOCF/LOCF imputation for response endpoints will be used. In this analysis BOCF imputation (ie, a subject would be a nonresponder) would be used for missing data due to discontinuation for reasons of lack of efficacy, adverse event or death up to the timepoint of interest, and LOCF imputation would be used for missing data for any other reason.\nThe incidence and number of days per week of rescue medication use will be analyzed for Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24 and 32, and the amount of rescue medication use per week will be analyzed for Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 16 and 24. The incidence of use of rescue medication will be analyzed using logistic regression for binary data, with model terms for Baseline WOMAC Pain subscale score, Baseline Diary Average Pain, index joint, Kellgren-Lawrence grade and treatment group.

In addition, significance testing will be performed for adverse events of interest between each tanezumab group and placebo. There will be no multiplicity adjustment for these significance tests.\nIncidence of orthostatic hypotension using postural changes in blood pressure, in addition to mean changes in postural blood pressure will be summarized.\nThe Survey of Autonomic Symptoms (SAS) scores will be summarized by treatment group for the total number of symptoms reported and total impact score. The summary will be shown by visit, and for the change from Baseline.\nThe Neuropathy Impairment Score (NIS) is the sum of scores over all 37 items from both the Left and Right side. The change from baseline to each post-baseline visit in the NIS, (using LOCF for missing data), and to worst (largest) change from Baseline (over all post-Baseline visits) will be summarized, and analyzed using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test (stratified by the combinations of two stratification factors).

Copies of all relevant clinical information including the items listed above should be provided to Pfizer or its designee for review by the external Adjudication Committee. Copies of the information should include the study number, site number and subject number, but it should not include the subject\u2019s name or initials.\nThe external E-DMC will be provided with a blinded summary of the Adjudication Committee\u2019s review of events after each review meeting.\n9.6. Data Monitoring Committee\nAn independent, E-DMC has been instituted for the tanezumab clinical program. This committee will be composed of at least one rheumatologist, neurologist, statistician, and epidemiologist. The E-DMC will review unblinded safety data including (but not limited to) adverse events and serious adverse events on a regular basis throughout the trial. Adverse events of syncope, bradycardia, orthostatic hypotension, anhidrosis or hypohidrosis along with other adverse events that are possibly related to the sympathetic nervous system will be monitored by the E-DMC during review of unblinded safety data. The E-DMC will have written operating procedures and a Charter, including a specific description of the scope of their responsibilities.\nThe E-DMC will be responsible for ongoing monitoring of the safety of subjects in the study according to the Charter. If the blinded Adjudication Committee identifies adjudicated events of rapidly progressive osteoarthritis type 2, subchondral insufficiency fracture (spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee [SPONK]), primary osteonecrosis or pathological fracture,occurring at a rate that could trigger the protocol-based stopping criteria, an urgent, ad hoc assessment of the events will be made by the E-DMC.\nAny recommendations made by the E-DMC to alter the conduct of the study will be forwarded to Pfizer for final decision. Pfizer will forward such decisions which may include summaries of aggregate analyses of endpoint events and of safety data which are not endpoints, to regulatory authorities, as appropriate.\nPfizer Standard Operating Procedures regarding periodic safety reviews by the study team and the Tanezumab Risk Management Committee will be followed. This committee will be composed of members inside and outside the immediate study team who will review blinded safety data from individual studies as well as data pooled across the studies on an ongoing basis. A safety review plan will be in place governing the frequency and extent of safety review.\n9.6.1. Protocol-Level Rules for Dosing Suspension/Safety Assessment\n9.6.1.1.

Pfizer performs blinded review of all serious adverse event data (including those serious adverse events specified below) and a cumulative review on a monthly basis. If blinded review notes a pre-specified serious adverse event occurring at a rate that could trigger the protocol-based dosing suspension rule (ie, at least 3 or more cases of a given pre-specified serious adverse event), an urgent, ad hoc assessment by the E- DMC will be conducted. The E-DMC will determine whether a protocol-based dosing suspension rule should be triggered. At the individual protocol-level, if a given pre-specified serious adverse event is reported in 3 more subjects in any individual tanezumab treatment group than for control group subjects, the protocol-based rule for dosing suspension will be triggered.\nThe pre-specified serious adverse events are:\n\u2022 Sudden cardiac death or cardiac death.\n\u2022 Acute renal failure.\n\u2022 Anaphylactic shock or severe anaphylactic reaction.\n\u2022 Neuropathic joint or neuropathic arthropathy (ie, Charcot joint).\n\u2022 Peripheral neuropathy confirmed with objective findings such as treatment-emergent abnormalities on neurologic examination, nerve conduction abnormalities or biopsy findings consistent with peripheral neuropathy.\n\u2022 One of the events related to sympathetic dysfunction (orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, syncope, anhidrosis, or hypohidrosis).\nIf a protocol-based rule for dosing suspension is triggered, it will result in suspension of further dosing of subjects in the study until a decision is reached regarding whether it is safe to resume dosing in some or all treatment groups or whether the study should be terminated completely. This decision will be made by the Sponsor in consultation with the tanezumab E-DMC.\nIf the protocol-based stopping rule is triggered, the E-DMC will consider the implications of this action on a program-level basis and formulate a recommendation whether it is safe to continue dosing (for some or all treatment groups) in other ongoing tanezumab clinical studies. Decisions regarding stopping treatment in other ongoing tanezumab clinical studies will be made by the Sponsor in consultation with the E-DMC.\nFactors that may be considered in making this decision in relation to serious adverse events or adjudicated clinically significant adverse events include:\n\u2022 Consideration of relationship of investigational product to the adverse event;\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 101",

Events consistent with Hy\u2019s Law\nIf two events are reported which are consistent with Hy\u2019s Law in tanezumab-treated subjects, irrespective of dose across all ongoing osteoarthritis and chronic low back pain studies, dosing will be temporarily suspended in all studies until the relationship to investigational product is established for the given events which were consistent with Hy\u2019s Law. If two events consistent with Hy\u2019s Law are considered to be related to treatment with tanezumab or the cause cannot be determined, all dosing in the tanezumab osteoarthritis and chronic low back pain program may be stopped. The E-DMC will determine whether the dosing suspension should be triggered. Subsequently the E-DMC will formulate a recommendation whether all studies should be permanently terminated. Decisions regarding permanently stopping treatment and terminating studies will be made by the Sponsor in consultation with the DMC.\n9.6.2. Joint Safety Events\nIf the blinded Adjudication Committee identifies adjudicated events of rapidly progressive osteoarthritis type 2, subchondral insufficiency fractures (or spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee [SPONK]), primary osteonecrosis, or pathological fracture occurring at a combined rate that could trigger the protocol-based stopping criteria, an urgent, ad hoc assessment of the events will be made by the External Data Monitoring Committee.\nThe protocol (or treatment group) stopping rule has three components; the difference in the number of subjects with an adjudicated joint safety event, the exposure-adjusted risk difference (RD) and the exposure adjusted risk ratio (RR) between each tanezumab treatment group and the active comparator group. The exposure-adjusted RD will be calculated as the difference in the ratios of the number of subjects with an adjudicated joint safety event divided by exposure (subject-years) between each tanezumab group and the comparator group. The exposure-adjusted RR will be similarly calculated using the ratio of exposure adjusted event rates (number of subjects with an adjudicated joint safety event divided by exposure) for each tanezumab group relative to the comparator group. The exposure will be calculated as the combined treatment and follow-up periods.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 102",

QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE\nPfizer or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits during study conduct to ensure that the protocol and Good Clinical Practices (GCPs) are being followed. The monitors may review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs are accurate. The investigator and institution will allow Pfizer monitors/auditors or its agents and appropriate regulatory authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification. This verification may also occur after study completion.\nDuring study conduct and/or after study completion, the study site may be subject to review by the institutional review board (IRB)/ethics committee (EC), and/or to quality assurance audits performed by Pfizer, or companies working with or on behalf of Pfizer, and/or to inspection by appropriate regulatory authorities.\nThe investigator(s) will notify Pfizer or its agents immediately of any regulatory inspection notification in relation to the study. Furthermore, the investigator will cooperate with Pfizer or its agents to prepare the study site for the inspection and will allow Pfizer or its agent, whenever feasible, to be present during the inspection. The investigator will promptly provide copies of the inspection findings to Pfizer or its agent. Before response submission to the regulatory authorities, the investigator will provide Pfizer or its agents with an opportunity to review and comment on responses to any such findings.\nIt is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the process.\n11. DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING\n11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record\nAs used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study.\nA CRF is required and should be completed for each included subject. The completed original CRFs are the sole property of Pfizer and should not be made available in any form to third parties, except for authorized representatives of Pfizer or appropriate regulatory authorities, without written permission from Pfizer.\nThe investigator has ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting of all clinical, safety and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 103",

The CRFs must be signed by the investigator or by an authorized staff member to attest that the data contained on the CRFs is true. Any corrections to entries made in the CRFs, source documents must be dated, initialed and explained (if necessary) and should not obscure the original entry.\nIn most cases, the source documents are the hospital's or the physician's subject chart. In these cases data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts.\nIn some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF, may also serve as source documents. In these cases, a document should be available at the investigative site as well as at Pfizer and clearly identify those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the source document.\n11.2. Record Retention\nTo enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or Pfizer, the investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating subjects (sufficient information to link records, eg, CRFs and hospital records), all original signed informed consent documents, copies of all CRFs, safety reporting forms, source documents, and detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant correspondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, telephone calls reports). The records should be retained by the investigator according to the ICH guidelines, according to local regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study Agreement (CSA), whichever is longer.\nIf the investigator becomes unable for any reason to continue to retain study records for the required period (eg, retirement, relocation), Pfizer should be prospectively notified. The study records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to Pfizer, such as another investigator, another institution, or to an independent third party arranged by Pfizer. Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of 15 years after completion or discontinuation of the study or for longer if required by applicable local regulations.\nThe investigator must obtain Pfizer's written permission before disposing of any records, even if retention requirements have been met.\n12. ETHICS\n12.1. Institutional Review Board / Ethics Committee\nIt is the responsibility of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study protocol, protocol amendments, informed consent documents, and other relevant documents, eg, recruitment advertisements, if applicable, from the IRB/EC. All correspondence with the IRB/EC should be retained in the Investigator File. Copies of IRB/EC approvals should be forwarded to Pfizer. The investigator should also receive approval from the national competent authority before implementing a substantial amendment.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 104",

If the study subject does not provide his or her own consent, the source documents must record why the subject did not provide consent (eg, minor, decisionally impaired adult), how the investigator determined that the person signing the consent was the subject\u2019s legally acceptable representative, the consent signer\u2019s relationship to the study subject (eg, parent, spouse), and that the subject\u2019s assent was obtained, or waived. If assent is obtained verbally it must be documented in the source documents.\nThe investigator, or a person designated by the investigator, will obtain written informed consent from each subject or the subject's legally acceptable representative before any study-specific activity is performed. The investigator will retain the original of each subject's signed consent document.\n12.4. Subject Recruitment\nAdvertisements approved by IRBs/ECs and investigator databases may be used as recruitment procedures.\nPfizer will have an opportunity to review and approve the content of any study recruitment materials directed to potential study subjects before such materials are used.\n12.5. Reporting of Safety Issues and Serious Breaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP\nIn the event of any prohibition or restriction imposed (ie, clinical hold) by an applicable Competent Authority in any area of the World, or if the investigator is aware of any new information which might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the investigational product, Pfizer should be informed immediately.\nIn addition, the investigator will inform Pfizer immediately of any urgent safety measures taken by the investigator to protect the study subjects against any immediate hazard, and of any serious breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP that the investigator becomes aware of.\n13.

Lifestyle Guidelines for Subjects from Sites in Sweden\nFor sites in Sweden, all female subjects who are of childbearing potential and are sexually active and at risk of pregnancy must agree to use one (1) highly effective method of contraception consistently and correctly for the duration of the active treatment period and for 112 days (16 weeks) after the last dose of investigational product. The investigator or his or her designee, in consultation with the subject, will confirm that the subject has selected the most appropriate method of contraception for the individual subject from the permitted list of contraception methods (see below) and instruct the subject in its consistent and correct use. Subjects need to affirm that they meet the criteria for correct use of one of the selected methods of contraception. The investigator or his/her designee will discuss with the subject the need to use highly effective contraception consistently and correctly according to the Schedule of Activities (SOA) and document such conversation in the subject\u2019s chart. In addition, the investigator or his or her designee will instruct the subject to call immediately if the selected contraception methods are discontinued or if pregnancy is known or suspected in the subject or the subject\u2019s partner.\nHighly effective methods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly (ie, perfect use) and include the following:32\n1. Established use of hormonal methods of contraception is allowed provided the subject plans to remain on the same treatment throughout the entire study and has been using that hormonal contraceptive for an adequate period of time to ensure effectiveness. Acceptable methods include:\ncombined (estrogen and progestogen-containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation:\nL]\noral\nL]\nintravaginal\nL]\ntransdermal\nL]\nprogestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation*:\nL]\noral\nL]\ninjectable\nL]\nimplantable\n*Progestogen-only oral hormonal contraception where inhibition of ovulation is not the primary mode of action is not accepted as a highly effective method.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 138",

France Appendix\nThis appendix applies to study sites located in France.\n1. GCP Training\nPrior to enrollment of any subjects, the investigator and any sub-investigators will complete the Pfizer-provided Good Clinical Practice training course (\u201cPfizer GCP Training\u201d) or training deemed equivalent by Pfizer. Any investigators who later join the Study will complete the Pfizer GCP Training or equivalent before performing Study-related duties. For studies of applicable duration, the investigator and sub-investigators will complete Pfizer GCP Training or equivalent every three years during the term of the Study, or more often if there are significant changes to the ICH GCP guidelines or course materials.\n2. Investigational Product\nNo subjects or third-party payers will be charged for investigational product.\n3. Inspections\nThe investigator(s) will notify Pfizer or its service provider immediately of any regulatory inspection notification in relation to the study. Furthermore, the investigator will cooperate with Pfizer or its service provider to prepare the study site for the inspection and will allow Pfizer or its service provider (if not prohibited by law) to be present during the inspection. The study site and investigator will promptly resolve any discrepancies that are identified between the study data and the subject's medical records. The investigator will promptly provide copies of the inspection findings to Pfizer or its service provider. Before response submission to the regulatory authorities, the investigator will provide Pfizer or its service provider with an opportunity to review and comment on responses to any such findings.\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 140",
