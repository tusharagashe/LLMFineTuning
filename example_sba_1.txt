From a Clinical Pharmacology perspective, the application is acceptable.   
1.2 Phase IV Commitments
None. 
1.3 Summary of Clinical Pharmacology Findings 
 
Pharmacokinetics
 
As stated in the label, steady-state mean concentration (Cmean) exposure was similar between 162 mg QW SC and 8 mg/kg IV Q4W regimens (Cmean of 48.6 and 58.4 mcg/mL, respectively). In comparison, trough concentrations were 2.4 times higher (44.6 versus 18.7 mcg/mL) and peak concentrations were 3 times lower (50.9 versus 154.7 mcg/mL) following 162 mg QW SC administration than following 8 mg/kg IV administration. The accumulation ratios for AUC, Cmin, and Cmax were 6.83, 6.37, and 5.47, respectively.  Steady state was reached after 12 weeks for AUC, Cmin, and Cmax. All exposure values following 162 mg Q2W  
SC regimen (9.7, 12.3, and 5.6 mcg/mL for Cmean, peak concentration Cmax, and Ctrough, respectively) were less than half of those following 162 mg QW SC regimen. The accumulation 
ratios for AUC, Cmin, and Cmax were 2.67, 5.6, and 2.12, respectively.  Steady state was reached after 12 weeks for AUC and Cmin, and after 10 weeks for Cmax. Therefore, steady-state TCZ PK  exposure were more than dose-proportionally higher following SC QW regimen than following Q2W regimen, which can be explained by significant nonlinear elimination pathway at low TCZ concentrations.   A population PK analysis using data from the first 24-week dosing periods of two Phase III studies (WA22762 and NA25220) was analyzed to assess A two-compartment population PK model with parallel linear and Michaelis-Menten elimination and first order absorption following SC administration were used to describe TCZ concentrations. Based on the population PK analysis, the bioavailability of TCZ following SC administration for a typical patient was estimated to be 79.5% (95%CI: 77.9 – 81.1%). Following SC dosing in rheumatoid arthritis patients, the absorption half-life was around 3-5 days.  The t1/2 of tocilizumab is concentration-dependent. For IV administration, the concentration-dependent apparent t1/2 is up to 11 days for 4 mg per kg and up to 13 days for 8 mg per kg every 4 weeks in patients with RA at steady-state.  For SC administration, the concentration-dependent apparent t1/2 is up to 13 days for 162 mg every week and 5 days for 162 mg every other week in patients with RA at steady-state.   The developed model had the same structure (with addition of the parameters for bioavailability and absorption) and similar PK parameter values as the population PK model developed earlier based on only IV data, which indicates that there are no differences in PK between IV and SC formulations.

Among all covariate relationships for PK exposure (i.e., HDL-cholesterol on CL, total protein and 
albumin on volumes, normalized creatinine clearance on V M, age and study on k a, and injection site 
on bioavailability), body weight was identified as the single covariate that significantly influence 
TCZ CL and volume parameters. Corresponding to a body weight range of 40 and 140 kg, CL 
decreased and increased respectively by 25% and 47%, and volumes decreased and increased 
respectively by 32% and 61% relative to the value corresponding to a patient weighting 70 kg.  
 
 
Dose justification 
 
Dose justification by the sponsor was relied partially on the developed PK exposure-DAS28 
response model, but caveats should be given to interpret the results. The developed model led to the conclusion that the main driver for DAS28 response is TCZ exposure and no other variables 
have been identified as significant to impact efficacy response. However, two key demographic 
pieces of information, body weight and geographical region, were not evaluated during covariate model building for DAS28 response. It was observed that patients in the heaviest weight group (>=100 kg) and/or patients from in North America had the lowest efficacy responses for both the 162 mg SC QW and the 8 mg/kg IV Q4W regimens. It is also known that drug exposure is positively related to body weight following the 8 mg/kg IV Q4W regimen so less drug exposure in >=100 kg body weight group cannot be used as the sole reason for the decreased efficacy. Further assessment of body weight and geographic region effect on DAS28 response is needed for a future generation of the model.    Based on Phase III study results, TCZ 162 mg SC QW and 8 mg/kg IV Q4W treatment regimens demonstrated comparable efficacy. The TCZ 162 SC Q2W dosing regimen also showed clinically superior efficacy improvements to placebo. However, the efficacy effect was less pronounced in the > 100 kg weight group for 162 kg SC Q2W treatment compared to same body weight groups for 162 kg SC QW and 8 mg/kg IV Q4W treatments (50.0%, 50.8%, 38.5%, and 27.3% for 162 mg SC QW, 162 mg SC Q2W, 8 mg/kg IV Q4W, and placebo for ACR20 responses, respectively, at Week 24 in ITT population). By directly comparing the ACR20 responses of patients weighting > 100 kg between SC QW and SC Q2W treatments (i.e., 50.0 % vs. 38.5%), the decreased ACR responses for 162 mg SC Q2W treatment is likely to be associated with less drug exposure. In addition, it was reported that a substantial % of escape patients who escalated from the Q2W SC regimen to the QW SC regimen showed an improvement in efficacy. Therefore, dose escalation from SCQ2W to SC QW for patients weighting > 100 kg to gain therapeutic advantage is reasonable.   Clinical data supported the starting dosing regimen of 162 mg SC Q2W for patients weighting < 100 kg, mainly based on four reasons. First, the efficacy response in terms of ACR20 were observed to be >60% for both SC QW and SC Q2W regimens for patients weighting < 100 kg. Second, a higher safety risk was observed across studies for SC QW than for SC Q2W in terms of % of patients with any AE and grades 1 & 2 neutropenia. The exposure–safety model also predicted higher grades 3 & 4 neutropenia risk for QW regimen. Third, overview of AEs leading to dose modifications/ interruptions in studies WA22762 and NA25220 until Week 24 or clinical cutoff in safety population showed that the incidence of such events was higher in the SC QW treatment than in the SC Q2W treatment (27.3% vs. 13.5% at Week 24 and 36.1% vs. 16.7% at

ACTEMRA® (Tocilizumab) 
 6clinical cutoff). Starting from SC Q2W regimen may lend patients the opportunity for safety 
tolerance development to TCZ regimen and has the advantage of less dose modifications/interruptions. Fourth, the approved IV dosing regimen also recommends starting from a low dose of 4 mg/kg Q4W that can be escalated to 8 mg/kg Q4W based on clinical response.   In summary, the proposed dosing regimen for TCZ SC treatment seems reasonable.

2.2  General Clinical Pharmacology 
 
2.2.1. What are the clinical pharmacology and clinical trials used to support the proposed 
claims? 
 
This submission is primarily based on two pivotal phase III clinical trials in patients with RA  (NA25220 and WA22762). As included in the submission, there are also a total of six clinical pharmacology studies that were designed to characterize the PK and PD profiles of TCZ following IV and SC administration and to evaluate the immunogenicity of TCZ when administered subcutaneously. Details of the clinical pharmacology studies are listed in Table 1 and the phase III studies including another study being conducted in Japan are listed in Table 2.  Study schemes of WA22762 and NA25220 are exhibited in Figures 1 & 2, respectively. PK data for population PK analysis were derived from these two phase III trials (i.e., WA22762 and NA25220).

 12administration than following 8 mg/kg IV administration. All exposure values following 162 mg 
Q2W SC regimen (9.7, 12.3, and 5.6 mcg/mL for Cmean, peak concentration Cmax, and Ctrough, respectively) were less than half of those following 162 mg QW SC regimen. Therefore, steady-state TCZ PK exposure were more than dose-proportionally higher following QW SC regimen than following Q2WQ2W regimen, which can be explained by significant nonlinear elimination pathway at low tocilizumab concentrations.  A population PK analysis was conducted to study TCZ bioavailability and PK parameters. A total of 13,642 serum concentrations from 1759 patients from the first 24-week dosing periods of two Phase III studies (WA22762 and NA25220) were analyzed. A two-compartment population PK model with parallel linear and Michaelis-Menten elimination and first order absorption following SC administration were used to describe TCZ concentrations. Based on the population PK analysis, the bioavailability of TCZ following SC administration for a typical patient was estimated to be 79.5% (95%CI: 77.9 – 81.1%). The other estimates for key PK parameters include a linear portion of clearance (CL) of 0.216 L/day (95%CI: 0.211 - 0.221 L/day), a central volume of distribution (V2) of 4.51 L (95%CI: 4.37 - 4.65 L), an inter-compartmental clearance (Q) of 0.274 L/day (95%CI: 0.262 - 0.285 L/day), a peripheral volume of distribution (V3) of 2.77 L (95%CI: 2.68 - 2.87 L), a maximum elimination rate (VM) of 1.85 mg/L/day (95%CI: 1.82 - 1.89 mg/L/day), a Michaelis-Menten constant (KM) of 0.343 ȝg/mL (95%CI: 0.327 - 0.36 
ȝg/mL), and an absorption rate constant (ka) of 0.233 day-1 (95%CI: 0.221 - 0.246 day-1). 
The developed model had the same structure (with addition of the parameters for bioavailability and absorption) and similar PK parameter values as the population PK model developed earlier based on only IV data, which indicates that there are no differences in PK between IV and SC formulations.   
Among all covariate relationships for PK exposure (i.e., HDL-cholesterol on CL, total protein and 
albumin on volumes, normalized creatinine clearance on V M, age and study on k a, and injection site 
on bioavailability), body weight was identified as the single covariate that significantly influence 
TCZ CL and volume parameters. Corresponding to a body weight range of 40 and 140 kg, CL 
decreased and increased respectively by 25% and 47%, and volumes decreased and increased 
respectively by 32% and 61% relative to the value corresponding to a patient weighting 70 kg.  
 
2.2.4. What are the PD characteristics of tocilizumab in patients? 
 
Based on graphical analysis, it was observed that inflammation biomarkers CRP and ESR decreased 
with time and with increasing exposure; mechanism based biomarker sIL-6R levels increased with 
time and with increasing exposure. Post drug treatment, the between subject variability observed in CRP, ESR, and sIL-6R decrease with increasing exposure. Less pronounced effects were seen in 
CRP, ESR, and sIL-6R responses with the 162 mg SC Q2W regimen than the 162 mg SC QW 
regimen and 8 mg/kg IV Q4WQ4W regimens. 
2.2.5. What are the key results from the population PK analysis? 
 
See section 2.3.1.  
2.2.6. Is the proposed dosing regimen justified?

ACTEMRA® (Tocilizumab) 
 13The SC dose regimens for the two Phase III studies (WA22762 and NA25220) were determined 
based on the PK, PD, and safety data from two Phase I/II studies (i.e., MRA227JP and NP22623) in 
patients with RA. Based on these two study results, it was found that the PD profiles (CRP, ESR, and 
sIL-6R) corresponding to the TCZ162 mg SC QW regimen were most comparable to those following 
the 8 mg/kg TCZ IV Q4W regimen. In comparison, the162 mg SC Q2W regimen led to slower and 
less pronounced PD responses than 8 mg/kg IV Q4W and 162 mg SC QW regimens. However, the PD responses following the 162 mg SC Q2W regimen were superior to the 81 mg SC Q2W and QW 
regimens. 
 
Although dose justification by sponsor was partially relied on the developed PK exposure-
DAS28 response model, caveats should be given to interpret the results. The developed PK exposure-DAS28 response model led to the conclusion that the main driver for DAS28 response is TCZ exposure and no other variables have been identified as significant to impact efficacy response. However, two key demographic information, body weight and region, were not 
evaluated during covariate model building for DAS28 response. It was observed that patients in 
the heaviest weight group (>=100 kg) and/or patients from in North America had the lowest efficacy responses for both the 162 mg SC QW and the 8 mg/kg IV Q4W regimens. It is also known that drug exposure is positively related to body weight following the 8 mg/kg IV Q4W regimen so less drug exposure in >=100 kg body weight group cannot be used as the sole reason for the decreased efficacy. Further assessment of body weight and geographic region effect on DAS28 response is needed for a future generation of the model.    Based on Phase III study results, TCZ 162 mg SC QW and 8 mg/kg IV Q4W treatment regimens demonstrated comparable efficacy. The TCZ 162 SC Q2W dosing regimen also showed clinically superior efficacy improvements to placebo. However, the efficacy effect was less pronounced in the > 100 kg weight group for 162 kg SC Q2W treatment compared to same body weight groups for162 kg SC QW and 8 mg/kg IV Q4W treatments (50.0%, 50.8%, 38.5%, and 27.3% for 162 mg SC QW, 162 mg SC Q2W, 8 mg/kg IV Q4W, and placebo in terms of ACR20 responses, respectively, at Week 24 in ITT population). By directly comparing the ACR20 responses of patients weighting > 100 kg between SC QW and SC Q2W treatments (i.e., 50.0 % vs. 38.5%), the decreased ACR responses for 162 mg SC Q2W treatment is likely to be associated with less drug exposure. In addition, it was reported that a substantial % of escape patients who escalated from the Q2W SC regimen to the QW SC regimen showed an improvement in efficacy. Therefore, dose escalation from SCQ2W to SC QW for patients weighting > 100 kg to gain therapeutic advantage is reasonable.   Clinical data supported the starting dosing regimen of 162 mg SC Q2W for patients weighting < 100 kg, mainly based on four reasons. First, the efficacy response in terms of ACR20 were observed to be >60% for both SC QW and SC Q2W regimens for patients weighting < 100 kg. Second, higher safety risk were observed across studies for SC QW than for SC Q2W in terms of % of patients with any AE and grades 1 & 2 neutropenia. The exposure –safety model also predicted higher grades 3 & 4 neutropenia risk for QW regimen. Third, overview of AEs leading to dose modifications/ interruptions in studies WA22762 and NA25220 until Week 24 or clinical cutoff in safety population showed that the incidence of such events was higher in the SC QW treatment than in the SC Q2W treatment (27.3% vs. 13.5% at Week 24 and 36.1% vs. 16.7% at clinical cutoff). Starting from SC Q2W regimen may lend the opportunity to patients for tolerance development to TCZ regimen and has the advantage of less dose

 14modifications/interruptions. Fourth, the approved IV dosing regimen also recommends starting 
from a low dose of 4 mg/kg Q4W that can be escalated to 8 mg/kg Q4W based on clinical response.   In summary, the proposed dosing regimen for TCZ SC treatment seems reasonable. Refer to the appended pharmacometric report for additional dose justification details and the review by Dr. Miya Paterniti, Medical Officer, DPARP, for furt her information regarding effectiveness/safety 
of the tested doses. 
2.3 Intrinsic Factors 
2.3.1. What was the impact of demographic covariates on TCZ exposure? 
 
Body weight was identified as the single covariate that significantly influenced TCZ CL and volume parameters. Corresponding to a body weight range of 40 and 140 kg, CL decreased and increased respectively by 25% and 47%, and volumes decreased and increased respectively by 32% and 61% relative to the value corresponding to a patient weighting 70 kg. The other covariate-exposure relationships identified, which only had insignificant effect on PK profile, include HDL-cholesterol on CL, total protein and albumin on volumes, normalized creatinine clearance on VM, age and study on ka, and injection site on bioavailability. The findings are consistent with population PK models developed for IV formulation, where another body size measure, body surface area (BSA), had been identified as the most influential covariate for TCZ exposure.   Refer to the appended pharmacometric report for additional dose justification details.   
 
 
2.3.2. What were the immunogenicity findings for TCZ?  What was the impact of 
immunogenicity on exposure, efficacy, and/or safety? 
 
Consistent with immunogenicity (IM) rate reported for TCZ IV, the overall immunogenicity rate for TCZ SC was low (~1%). As inferred from population PK analysis based on two Phase III study data (WA22762 and NA25220), the linear portion of clearance has no appreciable difference between anti-TCZ antibody positive and negative patients. In the population exposure –response analyses of the relationships between exposure and DAS28 and between exposure and neutrophil count, neutralizing anti-TCZ antibodies were not identified as an covariate influencing both TCZ efficacy and safety.

analysis  a database composed of 1759 rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with 162 mg SC 
every week, 162 mg SC every other week, and 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks for 24 weeks. The pharmacokinetic parameters of tocilizumab did not change with time.  For the 162 mg every week dose, the  estimated  mean (±SD) steady-state AUC1week, Cmin and Cmax of 
tocilizumab were 8200 ± 3600 mcg•h/mL, 44.6 ± 20.6 mcg/mL, and 50.9 ± 21.8 mcg/mL, respectively.  The accumulation ratios for AUC, Cmin, and Cmax were 6.83, 6.37, and 5.47, respectively.  Steady state was reached after 12 weeks for AUC, Cmin, and Cmax. For the 162 mg every other week dose, the  estimated  mean (±SD) steady-state 
AUC2week, Cmin, and Cmax of tocilizumab were 3200 ± 2700 mcg•h/mL, 5.6 ± 7.0 mcg/mL, and 12.3 ± 8.7 mcg/mL, respectively.  The accumulation ratios for AUC, Cmin, and Cmax were 2.67, 5.6, and 2.12, respectively.  Steady state was reached after 12 weeks for AUC and Cmin, and after 10 weeks for Cmax.   
Absorption
 
Following SC dosing in rheumatoid arthritis patients, the absorption half-life was around  days. The estimated steady state  bioavailability for the SC formulation was around 0.8 at the 
therapeutic doses. 
 
Elimination 
The t1/2 of tocilizumab is concentration-dependent. For IV administration, the concentration-
dependent apparent t1/2 is up to 11 days for 4 mg per kg and up to 13 days for 8 mg per kg every 4 weeks in patients with RA at steady-state.  For SC administration, the concentration-dependent 
apparent t1/2 is up to 13 days for 162 mg every week and up to  5 days for 162 mg every other 
week in patients with RA at steady-state.

1 SUMMARY OF FINDINGS 
1.1 Key Review Questions 
The purpose of this review is to address the following key questions. 
1.1.1 What are the main population PK findings for tocilizumab (TCZ) 
dose/dosing regimen in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients following subcutaneous (SC) administration? 
Among all the covariates explored, body weight was identified as the only significant 
covariate on TCZ clearance and volume of distribution. Based on the final model, patients 
weighing 40 and 140 kg are associated with decreased and increased clearance (CL) by 25% 
and 43%, respectively, compared to a patient weighing 70 kg. Moreover, volume of distribution (VD) decreased and increased by 32% and 61% respectively, compared to a 
patient weighing 70 kg.  These covariate findings support the weight-derived dosing regimen.  
 
A developed 2-compartment population PK (popPK) model adequately described the time course of serum TCZ concentration following SC administration in subjects with active RA. In the model, total CL is the su m of both linear (concentration-independent) 
and nonlinear (concentration-independent) components. For the linear elimination pathway, a mean CL of around 9 mL/h was estimated from the final popPK model. The nonlinear elimination pathway of TCZ is believed to describe a target-mediated clearance process due to the binding to the target IL-6R. It was estimated that a linear PK profile will be observed at TCZ serum concentrations of > 40 ȝg/mL. The saturation of the 
nonlinear elimination pathway was more pronounced with the 162 mg QW SC and the 8 mg/kg Q4W IV regimen, resulting in less variation of total clearance over the dosing interval at steady-state compared to 162 mg Q2W SC dosing.  Due to the dependence of total clearance on TCZ serum concentrations, the half-life of TCZ is also concentration-
dependent. Based on the popPK model, an effective half-life was estimated for TCZ serum concentrations at steady-state. During an inter-dose interval at steady state, the effective steady state half-life of TCZ was found to be between 12.1 and 13.0 days for 162 mg SC QW regimen and between 1.8 and 4.9 days for 162 mg SC Q2W regimen and between 6.6 and 18.6 days for 8 mg/kg IV Q4W regimen, based on the predicted concentration range at terminal phase. Following TCZ SC administration, the absorption half-life was estimated to be between 4 to 5 days and the bioavailability of TCZ was estimated to be 79.5% (95%CI: 77.9 – 81.1%).  
The final PK model based on data from Studies NA25220 and WA22762 retained the 
effects of weight and HDL-cholesterol on CL; weight, total protein and albumin on central and peripheral volumes; normalized creatinine clearance on Vmax; age and study on ka; and injection site on bioavailability. The covariate effect on exposure was assessed by referring to the observed range and the results were demonstrated in Figure 1 .

1.1.2 What is the rationale behind the proposed tocilizumab (TCZ) dose/dosing 
regimen in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients following subcutaneous (SC) administration?
The following shows the proposed TCZ dosing regimen in patients with RA:  
 
Patients less than 100 kg weight x162 mg administered subcutaneously every other 
week, followed by an increase to every week based on clinical response 
Patients at or above 100 kg 
weight x162 mg administered subcutaneously every 
week 
 
The SC dose regimens for the two Phase III  studies (studies WA22762 and NA25220) were 
determined based on the PK, PD, and safety data from two Phase I/II studies (i.e., MRA227JP and NP22623) in patients with RA. Based on these two study results, it was 
Reference ID: 3374458Tocilizumab (BLA125472)  Page 3 of 27 
BLA125472_PharmacometricsReview_final.docx found that the PD profiles (e.g., CRP, ESR, and sIL-6R) corresponding to the TCZ162 mg 
SC QW regimen were most comparable to those following the 8 mg/kg TCZ IV Q4W 
regimen. In comparison, the162 mg SC Q2W regimen led to slower and less pronounced PD 
responses than 8 mg/kg IV Q4W and 162 mg SC QW regimens. However, the PD responses 
following the 162 mg SC Q2W regimen was were superior to the 81 mg SC Q2W and QW 
regimens. Both a population PK model and exposure-response models for both efficacy 
and safety have been used to justify the SC dosing regimen.  
Although dose justification by sponsor was partially relied on the developed PK 
exposure-DAS28 response model, caveats should be given to interpret the results. The developed PK exposure-DAS28 response model led to the conclusion that the main driver for DAS28 response is TCZ exposure and no other variables have been identified as significant to impact efficacy response. However, two key demographic information, body weight and region, were not evaluated during covariate model building for DAS28 response. It was observed that patients in the heaviest weight group (>=100 kg) and/or patients from in North America had the lowest efficacy responses for both the 162 mg SC QW and the 8 mg/kg IV Q4W regimens. It is also known that drug exposure is positively related to body weight following the 8 mg/kg IV Q4W regimen so less drug exposure in >=100 kg body weight group cannot be used as the sole reason for the decreased efficacy. Further assessment of body weight and geographic region effect on DAS28 response is needed for a future generation of the model.   
Based on Phase III study results, TCZ 162 mg SC QW and 8 mg/kg IV Q4W treatment 
regimens demonstrated comparable efficacy. The TCZ 162 SC Q2W dosing regimen also showed clinically superior efficacy improvements to placebo. However, the efficacy effect was less pronounced in the > 100 kg weight group for 162 kg SC Q2W treatment compared to same body weight groups for162 kg SC QW and 8 mg/kg IV Q4W treatments (50.0%, 50.8%, 38.5%, and 27.3% for 162 mg SC QW, 162 mg SC Q2W, 8 mg/kg IV Q4W, and placebo in terms of ACR20 responses, respectively, at Week 24 in ITT population). By directly comparing the ACR20 responses of patients weighting > 100 kg between SC QW and SC Q2W treatments (i.e., 50.0 % vs. 38.5%), the decreased ACR responses for 162 mg SC Q2W treatment is likely to be associated with less drug exposure. In addition, it was reported that a substantial % of escape patients who 
escalated from the Q2W SC regimen to the QW SC regimen showed an improvement in 
efficacy. Therefore, dose escalation from SCQ2W to SC QW for patients weighting > 100 kg to gain therapeutic advantage is reasonable.  
Clinical data supported the starting dosing regimen of 162 mg SC Q2W for patients 
weighting < 100 kg, mainly based on four reasons. First, the efficacy response in terms of ACR20 were observed to be >60% for both SC QW and SC Q2W regimens for patients weighting < 100 kg. Second, higher safety risk were observed across studies for SC QW than for SC Q2W in terms of % of patients with any AE and grades 1 & 2 neutropenia. The exposure –safety model also predicted higher grades 3 & 4 neutropenia risk for QW regimen. Third, overview of AEs leading to dose modifications/ interruptions in studies WA22762 and NA25220 until Week 24 or clinical cutoff in safety population showed that the incidence of such events was higher in the SC QW treatment than in the SC Q2W treatment (27.3% vs. 13.5% at Week 24 and 36.1% vs. 16.7% at clinical cutoff). Starting from SC Q2W regimen may lend patients the opportunity for safety tolerance 
Reference ID: 3374458Tocilizumab (BLA125472)  Page 4 of 27 
BLA125472_PharmacometricsReview_final.docx development to TCZ regimen and has the advantage of less dose 
modifications/interruptions. Fourth, the approved IV dosing regimen also recommends starting from a low dose of 4 mg/kg Q4W that can be escalated to 8 mg/kg Q4W based on clinical response.  
In summary, the proposed dosing regimen for TCZ SC treatment seems reasonable.

2 RESULTS OF SPONSOR’S ANALYSIS 
2.1 Population PK analysis 2.1.1 Analysis Dataset 
The population PK database included dosing, PK and covariate data from the Phase III 
studies, WA22762 and NA25220. There were 13,642 samples from 1759 patients used in the 
analysis with the combined dataset. 
2.1.2 Model building 
The structural popPK model is an empirical two-compartment PK model with a first-order absorption to describe SC administration and both parallel linear and Michaelis-Menten 
eliminations. The nonlinear elimination pathway of tocilizumab was believed to represent a target-mediated clearance process due to the binding to IL-6R. Nonlinear mixed-effect 
modeling was conducted using NONMEM (version 7.2.0). 
By engaging prior learnings from the popPK model for TCZ IV, a covariate modeling 
approach emphasizing parameter estimation rather than stepwise hypothesis testing was used 
for covariate selection. A full model was established by incorporating potential covariate-parameter relationships identified based on prior learning, mechanistic plausibility, and 
exploratory graphics. The full model did not initially include strongly correlated or collinear 
covariates. Additional exploratory diagnostics for the full covariate model was conducted by 
graphical exploration of all measured covariate effects and the model was revised when 
necessary. The relationships suggested by the diagnostic plots of the base model were also tested. 
The effects of continuous covariates were modeled using a normalized power model while 
the effects of binary covariates were modeled by factor multiplication. 
 In summary, weight, BSA, sex, age, albumin, rheumatoid factor, and HDL-cholesterol were 
considered for CL; weight, BSA, sex, age, albumin, and total protein for central and peripheral volumes; age, injection site, weight, and BMI for absorption rate constant; 
injection site, weight, and BMI for bioavailability; albumin, normalized creatinine clearance, 
and smoking for VM constant. The base and covariate models developed with the dataset  
from Study WA22762 were updated, after performing external validation with dataset from 
Study NA25220, using the pooled dataset  from Studies WA22762 and NA25220. 
Reference ID: 3374458Tocilizumab (BLA125472)  Page 5 of 27 
BLA125472_PharmacometricsReview_final.docx Reviewer’s comment: no formal covariate selection procedure has been implemented for the 
popPK model for TCZ SC. However, given the model building procedure and validation for 
the popPK model for TCZ IV and the various model validation techniques used for the 
popPK model for TCZ SC, the model building procedure implemented for TCZ SC is 
reasonable. 
2.1.3 Model evaluation 
The developed models were extensively evaluated by basic graphical evaluations, ETA 
shrinkage, and predictive checks.  
Basic graphical evaluations included graphical plots checking  Observed Concentrations 
(DV) vs predicted concentrations (Population prediction (PRED), individual predictions (IPRED)), residual plots (conditional weighted residuals (CWRES), individual weighted residuals (IWRES) vs predictions and time), histograms and quantile-quantile plots (conditional weighted residuals and individual random effects (IIV)), plots for individual random effects (intercorrelations and relationship to covariates).  
For ETA shrinkage, the shrinkage percent for random effect KI is calculated by the 
following equation:

ඥȳሺ݅ǡ݅ሻቇ 
Here SDi was the standard deviation of the individual random effects estimates and (i,i) 
was the corresponding diagonal term of the random effects variance-covariance matrix estimated by the model.  
The employed predictive check procedures include Visual Predictive Check (VPC), 
Predictive Check Simulations (PCS) for the trough concentrations at week 24, Standardized Visual Predictive Check (SVPC), and Normalized Prediction Distribution Errors (NPDE).
 
2.1.4 Results
In summary, the developed two-compartment population PK model adequately 
characterized the time course of serum TCZ concentration following SC administration in subjects with active RA, as supported by all model evaluation approached employed. In the model, total CL was defined as the sum of both a linear (concentration-independent) component and a nonlinear (concentration-dependent) component.   Based on the final model, a mean linear CL was estimated to be  ~ 9 mL/h. The nonlinear elimination pathway of TCZ was believed to reflect the target-mediated clearance process as a result of TCZ binding to IL-6R. Based on the final model, it was expected that linear PK profile be apparent at TCZ serum concentrations of > 40 ȝg/mL. Therefore, the 
saturation of the nonlinear elimination pathway was more pronounced for the 162 mg SC QW and 8 mg/kg IV Q4W regimen, resulting in less variation of total clearance and thus drug exposure over the dosing interval at steady-state compared to 162 mg SC Q2W dosing regimen.  It was also expected that th e half-life of TCZ be also concentration-
dependent, given target medicated drug clearance and the dependence of total drug clearance on TCZ serum concentrations. Based on estimates from the final model and 
Reference ID: 3374458Tocilizumab (BLA125472)  Page 6 of 27 
BLA125472_PharmacometricsReview_final.docx simulations, the effective steady state half-life of TCZ was found to be between 1.8 and 
4.9 days, between 12.1 and 13.0 days, and between 6.6 and 18.6 for 162 mg SC Q2W, 162 mg SC QW regimen, and 8 mg/kg IV Q4W regimen, respectively, based on their concentration range in the terminal phase. Following TCZ SC administration, the absorption halflife was estimated to be between 4 to 5 days. The bioavailability of TCZ following SC administration was estimated to be 79.5% (95%CI: 77.9 – 81.1%).   
Based on model simulations, PK parameters following different SC regimens were 
simulated. For the 162 mg every week dose, the estimated mean (±SD) steady-state AUC
1 week , Cmin and Cmax of tocilizumab were 8200 ± 3600 mcg•h/mL, 44.6 ± 20.6 
mcg/mL, and 50.9 ± 21.8 mcg/mL, respectively.  The accumulation ratios for AUC, Cmin, and Cmax were 6.83, 6.37, and 5.47, respectively.  Steady state was reached after 12 weeks for AUC, Cmin, and Cmax. For the 162 mg every other week dose, the estimated mean (±SD) steady-state AUC2week, Cmin, and Cmax of TCZ were 3200 ± 2700 mcg•h/mL, 5.6 ± 7.0 mcg/mL, and 12.3 ± 8.7 mcg/mL, respectively.  The accumulation ratios for AUC, Cmin, and Cmax were 2.67, 5.6, and 2.12, respectively.  Steady state was reached after 12 weeks for AUC and Cmin, and after 10 weeks for Cmax. 
The final PK model retained the effects of weight and HDL-cholesterol on CL; weight, 
total protein and albumin on central and peripheral volumes; normalized creatinine clearance on VM; age and study on ka; and injection site on bioavailability. PK parameters associated with the final model is shown in Table 1. The covariate effect on exposure was assessed by referring to the observed range and the results were demonstrated in Table 2 and Figure 2. 
Among all identified covariate relationships body 
weight was identified as the only significant covariate on TCZ clearance and volume of 
distribution. Based on the final model, patients weighting 40 and 140 kg are associated with decreased and increased CL by 25% and 43%, and are associated with volume of 
distributions decreased and increased respectively by 32% and 61% respectively, compared 
to a patient weighting 70 kg. The negative correlation between body weight and drug 
exposure was verified by exploratory analysis as demonstrated by 
Figure 3 .  
Simulations based on the final model were conducted to derive PK exposure parameters 
based on dosing regimen and body weight (<60 kg, 60-100 kg, and >= 100 kg). Summary 
statistics of predicted individual steady-state exposure parameters were shown in Table 3.

BLA125472_PharmacometricsReview_final.docx 2.2 Exposure-effiacy response (DAS28) analysis 
2.2.1 Analysis Dataset 
The dataset for exposure-response analysis contained DAS28 measurements from a total of 
1890 subjects (i.e., 9430 DAS28 measurements from 1250 subjects of study WA22762 and 
4568 measurements from 640 subjects of study NA25220). Among the 1890 subjects, 629, 
621, 353, and 126 subjects received 8 mg/kg Q4W IV, 162 mg QW SC, 162 mg Q2W SC, or placebo TCZ doses, respectively; 90 and 71 subjects received placebo or 162 mg Q2W SC 
doses for 12 weeks , respectively, but escaped after week 12 by switching to 162 mg TCZ 
QW SC dosing regimen. DAS28 data were not available after week 12 for the majority of 
escaped subjects. 
2.2.2 Model building 
The time-course of DAS28 was described by an indirect-response model with inhibition of 
production rate driven by serum TCZ concentrations, which was also used to model the time-
course of DAS28 following IV administration. TCZ was assumed to inhibit ‘production’ of 
DAS28 via an Emax function.  
Full model with backward elimination was used to identify the final covariate model. 
Potential covariate-parameter relationships were identified based on scientific interest, mechanistic plausibility, and exploratory graphics, and were incorporated into the full model 
simultaneously with the notion not to include strongly correlated or collinear covariates. The 
full model development was also assisted by the additional graphical exploration of the 
measured covariate values vs estimates of individual random effects from the full model. 
During backward elimination, (1) precisely estimated covariates with clinically insignificant effects and (2) covariates with effects close to null value and/or with high relative standard 
error and/or with the 95% confidence intervals that included the null value were excluded 
from the final model. Increase of objective function value by less than 10.83 at a single covariate elimination was used as a criterion to exclude covariates, which was equivalent to 
eliminate covariates associated with wide covariate effect confidence intervals that were not 
statistically significant at Į=0.001 level. 
The following covariates were screened for their effects on efficacy: gender, age, baseline C-
reactive protein (CRP) and IL6, previous treatment with corticosteroids (PCOR), baseline values of health assessment questionnaire (HAQ), patient’s assessment of pain (PAIN), and 
physicians global score of disease activity (VASP) on the baseline value of DAS28; gender, 
age, baseline CRP, and PCOR on the first order elimination rate of DAS28 (kout in model); 
gender, age, and baseline CRP and IL6 on the TCZ concentration at which 50% of the 
maximum effect is reached (EC50 in model) and LEmax (LEmax defined with a relation to maximum drug effect Emax with a relation Emax=1/(1+LEmax) in model); and baseline IL6 
on the background effect of cocommitant DMARD therapies expressed in TCZ concentration 
equivalents (C
DMARD ).  The rationale for exploring these covariates was based on clinical 
importance, mechanistic plausibility, and prior knowledge from the previous analysis.

Reference ID: 3374458Tocilizumab (BLA125472)  Page 11 of 27 
BLA125472_PharmacometricsReview_final.docx The developed models were extensively evaluated by basic graphical evaluations, ETA 
shrinkage, and predictive checks.  
Basic graphical evaluations included graphical plots checking  Observed DAS28 values 
(DV) vs predicted concentrations (Population prediction (PRED), individual predictions (IPRED)) and time, residual plots (absolute conditional weighted residuals, individual weighted residuals (IWRES) vs predictions and time), histograms and quantile-quantile plots (conditional weighted residuals and individual random effects (IIV)), plots for individual random effects (intercorrelations and relationship to covariates) and their distribution plots stratified by the categorical covariates.  
For ETA shrinkage, the shrinkage percent for each random random effect Ki is calculated 
by the following equation:

Here SDi was the standard deviation of the individual random effects estimates and (i,i) 
was the corresponding diagonal term of the random effects variance-covariance matrix estimated by the model.  
 The precision of for parameter estiamtes were provided for each of the parameters and 
non-parametric bootstrap procedure is employed due to long run time for each iteration. The employed predictive check procedures include Visual Predictive Check (VPC), Predictive Check Simulations (PCS), Standardized Visual Predictive Check (SVPC), and Normalized Prediction Distribution Errors (NPDE). 
2.2.4 Results
 
Based on the report  ( Exposure-Efficacy Analyses of TCZ of Phase III Studies WA22762 
and NA25220 in Rheumatoid Arthritis ), the indirect-response model with an inhibitory 
effect on DAS28 ‘production’ rate by TCZ serum concentrations was used to describe the 
magnitude and the time-course of DAS28 score reduction. The model supported the 
observation that the 8 mg/kg IV Q4W and 162 mg SC QW dosing regimens have similar 
efficacy. Both the 8 mg/kg IV Q4W and 162 mg SC QW dosing regimens are also more 
efficacious than the 162 mg SC Q2W dosing regimen. 
Based on the final model, the population mean of the maximum effect of TCZ corresponds to 
56.5% reduction of DAS28 from baseline. The relationship between TCZ concentration and 
DAS28 is independent of the route of administration (i.e., IV vs SC). No covariate was found 
to have a clinical impact on the effect of TCZ on DAS28.  
The covariates that remained in the final model are as follows: baseline values of CRP, HAQ, 
VASP, and PAIN for DAS28 values at baseline (BASE parameter) with positive 
relationships, which is in line with the fact that all these covariates are markers of RA disease 
activity; gender for the maximum effect of tocilizumab (Emax) with higher Emax in males; 
age and baseline IL6 for Emax with positive relationships. These findings are consistent with 
the exposure-efficacy response analysis conducted based on IV data. The final model passed the model evaluation assessment as described in previous section. 
Reference ID: 3374458Tocilizumab (BLA125472)  Page 12 of 27 
BLA125472_PharmacometricsReview_final.docx To evaluate the covariate effects on DAS28 response (gender, age, baseline CRP, and 
baseline IL6), simulations were performed to predict the time courses of DAS28 
corresponding to different covariate levels.  It was found that males and younger patients 
tended to have slightly lower DAS28 levels. Subjects with high baseline CRP tended to have 
significantly higher baseline DAS28 scores. However, the simulation results predicted that 
the difference in DAS28 levels for different baseline CRP groups disappeared after about 10 weeks of dosing for the 162 mg SC QW and 8 mg/kg IV Q4W regimens. In comparison, the 
DAS28 difference remained almost constant throughout the course of treatment for the 162 
mg SC Q2W regimen. A slightly higher DAS28 scores was observed for subjects with higher 
IL6 levels but the DAS28 scores decreased to the same levels as in subjects with low baseline 
IL6 after 4-5 weeks for the 162 mg SC QW and 8 mg/kg IV Q4W regimens. 
Overall, except for baseline CRP level for 162 mg SC Q2W regimen, the rest of covariate 
effects on DAS28 projections were found to be small based on sponsor’s analysis. 
Simulations were performed based on the final model for the DAS28 time-course for a 24 
week treatment schedule. The simulated DAS28 profiles for three active treatments are 
shown in 
Figure 4 . It showed that DAS28 scores steadily decrease after a rapid drop during 
the first 8 weeks. The responses to TCZ regimens of 8 mg/kg IV Q4W and 162 mg SC QW 
were comparable and the response was relatively smaller for 162 mg SC Q2W regimen.

Reviewer’s comment: 
The relationship between exposure (Ctrough) and efficacy response in terms of ACR 
responses were also evaluated separately. As shown in Table 4 , ACR20/50/70 response rates 
was summarized by the four exposure quartiles for 8mg/kg IV, 162 mg SC QW and Q2W dose 
regimens. For the 162 mg Q2W SC treatment, there was an overall trend for an increase in 
the ACR response rate of any type with increased Ctrough. For the QW SC treatment, similar 
pattern was observed for ACR20 response but with a lesser extent. In contrast, the response rates of ACR 50 and 70 seemed to reach plateau level after the second Ctrough quartile. For 
the 8 mg/kg Q4W IV treatment, no clear trend toward a greater response with increasing 
Reference ID: 3374458Tocilizumab (BLA125472)  Page 14 of 27 
BLA125472_PharmacometricsReview_final.docx exposure as measured by Ctrough was observed. These findings indicate a clear exposure –
efficacy response relationship for the 162 mg TCZ SC Q2W dosing.    
Table 4  Patients with ACR responses at Week 24 by Ctrough quartiles (ITT-PK Population) 
(Studies WA22762 & NA25220) . 
 
Source:  Table 16 from report of Summary of Clinical Pharmacology  
In the reviewer’s opinion, Ctrough cannot be used as a universal TCZ PK exposure measure 
for ACR response and it as a measure of drug exposure should be interpreted in combination 
with dosing frequency (i.e., SC Q2W, SC QW, or IV Q4W ) and route of administration (i.e., 
IV vs. SC). As shown by Table 4 , higher Ctrough levels associated with a particular dosing 
frequency and/or route of administration could correspond to lower ACR responses 
compared to lower Ctrough levels associated with other dosing frequencies and/or route of 
administration.  For example, the mean Q3 Ctrough of 7.6 μg/ml associated with TCZ SC 
Q2W and the mean Q1 Ctrough of 4.1 μg/ml associated with TCZ IV Q4W were about 50% 
and 30% of the Q1 Ctrough of 14.6 μg/ml associated with TCZ SC QW, respectively. 
However, the ACR responses associated with the Q3 exposure of SC Q2W and Q1 exposure 
of IV Q4W were significantly higher than ones associated with the Q1 exposure of SC QW. 
Therefore, TCZ Ctrough only reflects the relative drug exposure within the same dosing frequency and dosing regimen. Caveat should be given when interpret Ctrough as an overall 
PK exposure measure. 
In the exposure-DAS28 response model, the contemporary TCZ serum concentration, instead 
of Ctrough, is used as a dynamic PK exposure input as the efficacy driver. This is in line with 
the reviewer’s opinion that Ctrough cannot be used as a universal PK exposure measure for efficacy response.  
The model predicted the main driver for DAS28 response is TCZ exposure and no other 
variables were identified as significant. Two key pieces of demographic information that the 
reviewer feels are important, body weight and region, were not evaluated during covariate 
model building.  
As indicated in subgroup analyses in the study report, although the proportion of patients 
achieving an ACR20 response was similar between arms within the regions and body weight 
groups, ACR responses differed either between regions (i.e., North America, South America, 
Europe, and the rest of world) or between body weight groups (<60 kg, 60-100 kg, and 
>=100 kg). Patients in the heaviest weight group (>=100 kg) and/or patients from in North America had the lowest responses for both the 162 mg SC QW and the 8 mg/kg IV Q4W 
regimens (
Table 5 and Table 6 ). 
Reference ID: 3374458Tocilizumab (BLA125472)  Page 15 of 27 
BLA125472_PharmacometricsReview_final.docx As shown in Table 5, a lower ACR20 response rate of 51% was observed in the >=100 kg 
body weight group than the rates of 71-76% in the other two weight groups following the 8 
mg/kg IV Q4W  treatment regimen. It has been found that drug exposure of patients with high 
body weight was relatively higher than drug exposure of patients with low body weight 
following 8 mg/kg IV dosing ( Table 3 ). The finding of relatively lower ACR20 response rate 
for patients weighting >=100 kg following TCZ IV administration cannot be supported by 
lower drug exposure and is likely to be related to high body weight and/or geographic 
region.  In addition, no strong collinearity relations were identified between body weight and other covariates such as baseline levels of CRP, Age, IL6, DAS28 that were evaluated in the 
model building process (
Figure 5). Therefore, potential relationship between body weight 
and efficacy response cannot be fully assessed. 
Taking all considerations into account, caveats should be given to interpret the exposure-
efficacy response as proposed given high correlation between DAS28 and ACR20 scores.  
Future model refinement needs to assess the impact of body weight and/or region on the efficacy response.

analysis
2.3.1 Analysis Dataset 
 
The dataset for exposure-safety response for population PK-neutrophil count analysis 
included dosing, neutrophil counts and covariate data from the Phase 3 studies WA22762 and NA25220. Only the data from the first 24-week dosing period of each study were included in 
the analysis. The number of subjects and observations in each study is shown in 
Table 7.

2.3.2 Model building 
2.3.2.1 Exposure-response model for neutrophil counts 
For the IV administration, the time-course of neutrophil counts was described by an indirect-
response model with stimulation of elimination rate that was described by a sigmoidal 
function of TCZ serum concentration. An updated model was also used to describe the time-course of neutrophil counts following TCZ SC administration. The updated model combined 
an immediate direct effect (that affected all circulating neutrophils) with the slow effect 
described by the indirect response model (that affected only a fraction of the circulating 
neutrophils). During base model selection, prediction performance with the indirect-response 
model and the updated model were compared by visual inspection of diagnostic scatter plots, plausibility of the parameter estimates, precision of the parameter estimates, the minimum 
objective function value (OFV) and the number of estimated parameters. The difference in 
the OFV between hierarchical models is asymptotically F2 distributed with a degree of 
freedom equal to the difference in number of parameters between the two models in 
comparison. A p value of 0.001 for one additional parameter corresponds to a difference in 
the objective function of 10.83.  
Full model with backward parameter elimination was used to establish the final covariate 
model. For full model, potential covariate-parameter relationships were identified based on 
scientific interest, mechanistic plausibility, knowledge gained from the previously developed model based on the IV data, and exploratory graphics. The full model did not simultaneously 
include effects of strongly correlated or collinear predictors. A similar backward elimination 
procedure to the one used for exposure-DAS28 response model was employed to derive the 
final covariate model. Please refer to section 2.2.2 for details. 
2.3.2.2 Graphical analysis of relationships between observed TCZ concentrations 
and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) and time course of main safety parameters  
Graphical analyses were used to explore potential relationships between drug exposure 
and safety responses in terms of SAE and other safety parameters. The following SAEs were evaluated:  any SAE, SAE of infections and infestations, SAE of gastrointestinal 
Reference ID: 3374458Tocilizumab (BLA125472)  Page 19 of 27 
BLA125472_PharmacometricsReview_final.docx disorders, SAE of cardiac disorders, SAE of neoplasms benign, malignant and 
unspecified (including cysts and polyps). The following safety parameters were evaluated: hematology (i.e., white blood cells, neutrophil, and platelets counts), biochemistry (i.e., total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), serum albumin, total protein, total cholesterol, cholesterol-HDL, cholesterol-LDL, and triglycerides) 
Graphical analyses for potential relationships between TCZ concentration and SAE were 
carried out by highlighting the observed TCZ concentration profiles of SAE positive subjects from the pool of all individual observed TCZ concentration profiles for each SAE category, excluding subjects from study 25220 that escaped starting at week 12 (e.g. who switched from Q2W to QW regimen). Visual comparison was used to check whether SAE positive subjects were associated with higher overall drug concentrations when compared to the population pool.  
Graphical analyses of the potential relationship between drug exposure and safety 
parameter responses were carried out by assessing the relationship between the observed values of the laboratory safety parameters and steady-state TCZ exposure (Ctrough). Ctrough value was computed using individual subject’s dosing history and the individual PK parameters from the final population PK model. Again, subjects from study 25220 that escaped at week 12 were excluded from the analysis. Equal number of subjects were assigned to low, medium, or high exposure categories based on 
Ctrough values within each 
treatment regimen. For each safety parameter, the individual observed tocilizumab 
concentration profiles were also overlaid and compared for subjects in each of the three exposure categories by treatment, and separately for placebo subjects from study 25220. 
2.3.3 Model evaluation 
The model evaluation procedure for exposure-neutrophil count model is similar to the 
one used for exposure-DAS28 response model. Refer to section 2.2.3 for details. 
2.3.4 Results
Overall, both models provided the excellent fit of the data. Therefore, the more parsimonious 
indirect-response model was selected both as the final base model and consequently the final 
model. 
For covariate evaluations, it was found that higher neutrophil count at baseline (BASE) was 
associated with males, smokers, and subjects with higher baseline C-reactive protein (CRP). 
Emax increased with increasing IL6 level. Therefore, the full model included the effects of 
CRP, age, and sex on all parameters, IL6 on Emax, concentration to achieve 50% effect 
(EC50), and baseline neutrophil count, PCOR and smoking (SMK) on baseline neutrophil 
count, and previous treatment with corticosteroids (PCOR) on first order elimination rate (Kout). Post backward elimination, the retained covariates were: baseline CRP, PCOR, and 
SMK on BASE; age on kout; gender on EC50, and baseline CRP and IL6 concentrations on 
Emax.  
Key parameters of the final model were estimated with reasonable precision for the structural 
parameters (relative standard error (RSE) = 1.2 - 7.7%), for the variances of the inter-individual random effects (RSE = 3.7 - 12%), for the residual error (RSE = 1%), for the 
covariate effects on BASE (RSE = 1.5-5.8%), and for the covariate effects on the other 
Reference ID: 3374458Tocilizumab (BLA125472)  Page 20 of 27 
BLA125472_PharmacometricsReview_final.docx parameters (RSE = 9.3 - 25.4%). In comparison, the inter-individual variability of the model 
parameters was high: 52.8%, 88.8%, and 152% for variances on Emax, EC50, and kout, 
respectively.  
The final model passed all model evaluation criteria. Specifically, the predictive check 
evaluations (VPC, SVPC, PCS, and NPDE plots) showed that the model captured the central 
tendency and the inter-individual variability of neutrophil counts, as well as the identified relations between covariates and PK-PD parameters.  
The magnitude of the covariate effects on model parameters is illustrated as in 
Table 8 . The 
covariate effects on the neutrophil time course were also assessed using simulations. The 
covariates evaluated were gender, smoking, previous administration of corticosteroids, age, 
CRP, and IL6 for each dosing regimen. Overall, except for CRP on 162 mg following SC 
Q2W regimen, the effects of all the rest parameters on the neutrophil time profile did not seem to be clinically significant.  
Based on the derived PK-PD model, rates of neutropenia for the three TCZ regimens 
following a 24-week dosing period and twice-a-week assessment for 32 weeks were 
simulated and the results are shown in 
Table 9 . It was shown that the rates of neutropenia for 
all grades were lower for the 162 mg SC Q2W dosing regimen and were similar between 8 
mg/kg IV Q4W and 162 mg SC QW regimens. More frequent sampling and high fluctuation of neutrophil counts due to high residual error led to higher than observed neutropenia rates.

Graphical exploration for potential relationship between drug exposure and SAE did not 
identify any prominent correlation. Overall, the occurrences of all types of SAEs were low 
(<5% for all SAE combined), and no pattern was found between the occurrence of SAEs of any categories (i.e., “Infections and Infestations”, "Gastrointestinal disorders", "Cardiac 
Disorders", "Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps)”) 
and treatments based on sponsor’s assessment. Subjects who experienced SAEs were not 
apparently associated with higher TCZ concentrations. 
Safety parameters, which were graphically evaluated for potential relationships between 
exposure category in terms of Ctrough and time course patterns, included  white blood cells, 
neutrophil counts, platelets, ALT, AST, total bilirubin, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, 
HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, serum albumin, and total protein.  
For white blood cells and neutrophils, it was found that time to steady-state counts and the 
steady-state levels decreased with increasing exposure.  For ALT, AST, total bilirubin, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides, slight increase in their 
levels over time were observed in all categories of exposure compared to the placebo group. 
However, no strong relationships between the increase and TCZ exposure or treatment 
regimen were identified. Similar patterns held for serum albumin levels with an exception 
that the combined data of the SC regimens seemed to show a slightly higher increase in the high exposure group compared to the low exposure group. For total protein, slight decrease 
over time was observed for all regimens including placebo and the decrease was not 
apparently related to drug exposure or treatment.  
Overall, the hematological safety parameters demonstrated higher than placebo safety risk 
that approached plateau at high exposures. In general, potential hematology safety risks were 
similar between the 162 mg SC QW and 8 mg/kg IV Q4W regimens. For the 162 mg SC 
Q2W, it was associated with less safety parameter response and higher variability was 
observed across its associated exposure categories.

Reference ID: 3374458Tocilizumab (BLA125472)  Page 22 of 27 
BLA125472_PharmacometricsReview_final.docx Based on sponsor’s safety report, the overall AE and infection rate was higher in the TCZ 
162 mg QW SC treatment (study WA22762) than in the 162 mg Q2W SC treatment (study 
NA25220)( Table 10 ) , although there was a lack of exposure response relationship within 
each treatment regimen .

population for studies WA22762 and NA25220).

The protocols for both pivotal studies WA22762 and NA25220 allowed for dose interruption 
of an infusion, skipping a dose, or dose reduction for the management of AEs (e.g., 
opportunistic infections and serious infections, GI perforations, demyelinating disorders, 
hematologic abnormalities and bleeding events, elevated liver enzymes, cardiovascular 
events and elevated lipids, malignancies, local ISRs, and hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis after SC injection). The most commonly reported system organ classes (SOCs) with AEs 
leading to dose modification included Infections and Infestations. 
As shown by 
Table  11 , it was found that the incidence of AEs leading to a dose 
modification/interruption either at Week 24 or at the clinical cutoff was significantly higher 
for 162 mg QW SC treatment (study WA22762) than for 162 mg Q2W SC treatment (Study 
NA25220: 36.1% vs. 16.7%). In comparison, the incidence was comparable between 162 QW 
SC and 8 mg/kg IV treatment (study WA22762: 36.1% for SC vs. 30.7% for IV).

Consistent with IV TCZ treatment as well as characterized by the exposure-neutrophil count 
model, SC administration of TCZ induced an exposure/dose-dependent decrease in 
neutrophil counts. As observed in study WA22762, the rates for Grade 1 or 2 neutropenia for 
SC TCZ QW and IV Q4W regimens were comparable with Week 24 IV TCZ data at Week 24. Although the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia at Week 24 was low and balanced across 
SC TCZ and IV TCZ dosing regimens, no evaluation has been reported whether this was 
attributable to dose modification or interruption due to safety events.
Based on the exposure-neutrophil count model simulations, the safety risk for grades 1-4 
neutropenia was the lowest in the 162 mg Q2W SC treatment among all the evaluated active 
treatment regimens (i.e., 162 mg QW SC, 162 mg Q2W SC, and 8 mg/kg Q4W IV). The 
neutropenia risk was almost doubled in the 162 mg QW SC and 8 mg/kg Q4W IV treatment 
regimens compared to the 162 Q2W SC treatment regimen (19% vs 12% for grade 3, and 2.0% vs 1.2% for grade 4). The simulated trend is consistent with the observed trend as 
summarized in 
Table 12  in the intent to treat (ITT) PK population for grades 1&2 
neutropenia incidence. It was also found the incidence of thrombocytopenia and ALT 
elevation was also lowest in the 162 mg Q2W SC treatment among the three active 
treatments.

Although the sponsor failed to identify a relationship between TCZ exposure and SAE 
incidence, the graphical analyses for potential relationship between drug exposure and SAE 
were mainly based on visual assessment and may be potentially involving subjective 
judgment. A reference to clinical safety review needed for an overall evaluation.     
Reviewer’s overall comments:  
In conclusion, TCZ 162 mg SC QW and 8 mg/kg IV Q4W treatment regimens demonstrated 
comparable efficacy. The TCZ 162 SC Q2W dosing regimen also showed clinically superior efficacy improvements to placebo. However, the efficacy effect is less pronounced in > 100 kg weight group for 162 kg SC Q2W treatment compared to 162 kg SC QW and 8 mg/kg IV Q4W treatments (50.0%, 50.8%, 38.5%, and 27.3% for 162 mg SC QW, 162 mg SC Q2W, 8 mg/kg IV Q4W, and placebo in terms of ACR20 responses, respectively, at Week 24 in ITT population). By 
directly comparing the ACR20 responses of patients weighting > 100 kg between SC QW and SC 
Q2W treatments (i.e., 50% vs. 38.2%), the decreased ACR responses for 162 mg SC Q2W treatment is likely to be associated with less drug exposure. In addition, it was reported that a substantial % of escape patients who escalated from the Q2W SC regimen to the QW SC regimen showed an improvement in efficacy. Therefore, dose escalation from SCQ2W to SC QW for 
patients weighting > 100 kg to gain therapeutic advantage is reasonable.  
Clinical data supported the starting dosing regimen of 162 mg SC Q2W for patients weighing < 
100 kg, mainly based on four reasons. First, the efficacy response in terms of ACR20 were observed to be >60% for both SC QW and SC Q2W regimens for patients weighting < 100 kg. 
Second, higher safety risk were observed across studies for SC QW than for SC Q2W in terms of 
% of patients with any AE and grades 1 & 2 neutropenia. The exposure –safety model also predicted higher grades 3 & 4 neutropenia risk for QW regimen. Third, overview of AEs leading to dose modifications/ interruptions in studies WA22762 and NA25220 until Week 24 or clinical cutoff in safety population showed that the incidence of such events is higher in the SC QW treatment than in the SC Q2W treatment (27.3% vs. 13.5% at Week 24 and 36.1% vs. 16.7% at 
clinical cutoff). Starting from SC Q2W regimen lends the opportunity to patients for tolerance to 
TCZ regimen and has the advantage of less dose modifications/interruptions. Fourth, the 
Reference ID: 3374458Tocilizumab (BLA125472)  Page 25 of 27 
BLA125472_PharmacometricsReview_final.docx approved IV dosing regimen also recommends starting from a low dose of 4 mg/kg Q4W that can 
be escalated to 8 mg/kg Q4W based on clinical response.

Stable Background DMARD(s)Treatment

[Image 12.1]:
Concentrations of TCZ in human serum samples were determined by two different validated
sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), the Chugai PK assay and Roche PK
assay methods. Biotin-labeled interleukin soluble receptor (IL-6 sR) was bound to streptavidin
coated microtiter plates in the first step. TCZ in the sample was bound to the immobilized biotin-
labeled IL-6 sR. The bound TCZ can be detected by digoxigenylated anti-TCZ antibodies
followed by an anti-DIG-POD (poly) conjugate and ABTS as a substrate.
The Chugai PK assay stayed the same as used in the original Biologics License Application and
Marketing Authorization Application (BLA125276) and was used in Study WP18097. The main
assay for this submission (BLA125472) was the Roche assay. This assay was first established
and validated at SRL and was used for Chugai studies MRA227JP and MRA229JP. It was also
established and validated at
BP21894, BP22065, NP22623, NP25539, WA22762 (Week 24 and LTE) and NA25220 (Week
24 and LTE). The summary of the assay performance during assay validation at

The bioanalytical assays fulfilled the regulatory criterion (refer to the FDA guidance for industry
"Bioanalytical Method Validation (Final-May 2001)) of not exceeding 15% (20% for the lowest
quality control (QC) samples) for precision and accuracy. The accuracy and inter-day precision
were acceptable (<15% bias or %CV). Study samples were analyzed in runs containing
calibrators and QC samples, as recommended in the FDA guidance. The assay sensitivity in
terms of LLOQ (lower limit of quantitation) was 100 ng/mL for TCZ (concentration in native
serum).
2.2.3. What are the PK characteristics of TCZ in RA patients following SC administration?.
TCZ bioavailability was estimated in healthy volunteers by dedicated studies (WP18097 and
BP22065) and population PK analysis. By direct comparison of AUC's following a single SC
and IV dose of 160 mg, an estimate of absolute bioavailability of 56.5% was observed with study
WP18097. As found in study BP22065, at a dose of 162 mg, the bioavailability after SC
administration was 48.8%. At 81 mg of TCZ, the absolute bioavailability after SC administration
was 22.7%. The increased bioavailability with increased dose reflected more than proportional
increase in drug exposure at high SC doses. Therefore, given the nonlinear nature for TCZ
clearance, all of these estimates must be taken with caution.
Based on population PK predictions, steady-state Cmean exposure was similar between 162 mg
QW SC and 8 mg/kg IV Q4W regimens (Cmean of 48.6 and 58.4 mcg/mL, respectively). In
comparison, trough concentrations were 2.4 times higher (44.6 versus 18.7 mcg/mL) and peak
concentrations were 3 times lower (50.9 versus 154.7 mcg/mL) following 162 mg QW SC

Dose Selection
Chosen on the basis of PKPD,and safety data from two Phase I/II
studies (MRA227JP and NP22623) in RA patients
TCZ SC dose regimens of 81 mg and 162 mg q2w/qw were tested
PDprofiles CRPESR,and sIL-6R)of theTCZSC 162 mg QW
regimen were found to be most comparable to the TCZ IV 8 mg/kg
dosing regimen
6R-TCZ complex,achieved CRP normalization,and resulted in an
ESR reduction from baseline
Despite being slower and less pronounced compared with the162 mg
qw dose regimen,the PD responses with the 162 mg q2w regimen were
superior to the lower SC doses tested (81 mg q2w/qw)
