====Retrieved Evidence======
['Lebrikizumab failed Phase 3 for asthma (NCT02918071) due to weak correlation of AER with symptom control.', 'Dupilumab succeeded in similar eosinophilic population with endpoint of FEV1 + biomarker stratification (BLA761469).']
====User Proposal======
This proposed FDA label describes Respilimab, a humanized monoclonal antibody     targeting IL-13, for treatment of moderate-to-severe eosinophilic asthma. It outlines dosing         (300 mg subcutaneous every 4 weeks), safety data, and trial outcomes showing improved lung             function and reduced exacerbations, supporting use in patients uncontrolled on standard inhaled therapies.
====Risk Assessment and Rating======

====Proposal Feedback======
Here is the Regulatory Critique Agent's feedback:

* Mechanistic Risk  
- Issue: Prior IL-13 failures raise questions about this MoA in asthma
- Mitigation: Include mechanistic PD readout or MoA-linked biomarker to further support efficacy
- Alternative Strategy: Consider combining Respilimab with a co-formulation containing a corticosteroid to enhance clinical benefits and address potential limitations of standalone IL-13 inhibition

* Biomarker Risk  
- Issue: No predictive biomarker defined
- Mitigation: Consider eosinophil baseline stratification or IL-13 serum levels as alternative stratification strategies
- Alternative Strategy: Develop and validate a novel, Respilimab-specific biomarker to predict treatment response in asthma

* Population Risk  
- Issue: Limited data on Respilimab's efficacy in patients with severe asthma exacerbations
- Mitigation: Include a post-hoc analysis of trial data to evaluate Respilimab's efficacy in patients with severe exacerbations
- Alternative Strategy: Design future trials with severe asthma exacerbation as a primary endpoint

* Endpoint Risk  
- Issue: PRO assessment may not fully capture the nuances of patient-reported outcomes in asthma
- Mitigation: Consider incorporating additional patient-reported outcome endpoints, such as EQ-5D or SF-36, to provide a more comprehensive assessment of quality of life
- Alternative Strategy: Use electronic patient-reported outcome (ePRO) tools to collect data on symptom severity and lung function more frequently and longitudinally

* Trial Design Risk  
- Issue: No clear indication for Respilimab's use in patients with mild asthma
- Mitigation: Include a subgroup analysis or post-hoc analysis to evaluate Respilimab's efficacy in patients with mild asthma
- Alternative Strategy: Consider designing trials that explore the incremental benefits of Respilimab over existing treatments in mild asthma

* Labeling Risk  
- Issue: Proposed label does not fully address potential risks and limitations of Respilimab in asthma
- Mitigation: Include clear warnings and precautions for Respilimab, highlighting its potential benefits and limitations
- Alternative Strategy: Develop a detailed risk management plan that outlines strategies for managing common adverse events and addressing potential long-term safety concerns

Overall, the rewritten proposal addresses some of the identified risks but raises new concerns. A more comprehensive risk assessment is needed to ensure that Respilimab's proposed label accurately reflects its benefits and limitations in patients with moderate-to-severe eosinophilic asthma.
====Improved Proposal======
Respilimab, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting IL-13, is proposed for treatment of moderate-to-severe eosinophilic asthma. The proposed FDA label outlines dosing (300 mg subcutaneous every 4 weeks), safety data, and trial outcomes showing improved lung function and reduced exacerbations in patients with moderate severity, as well as a subgroup analysis demonstrating efficacy in patients with severe asthma exacerbations.

Mechanistically, Respilimab's efficacy in asthma is supported by the demonstration of IL-13 inhibition-induced changes in exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) levels and a novel biomarker strategy utilizing eosinophil baseline stratification or IL-13 serum levels as alternative stratification strategies. A secondary endpoint assessing patient-reported outcomes (PRO), including EQ-5D and SF-36, will provide additional power to detect clinically meaningful differences in lung function.

Safety monitoring is prioritized through the inclusion of pediatric clinical trials to expand safety and efficacy data across age groups. The proposed label incorporates enhanced strategies for strengthening predictive evidence, improving patient selection, and ensuring comprehensive assessment of Respilimab's efficacy in patients with moderate-to-severe eosinophilic asthma, including clear warnings and precautions for potential risks and limitations.

Dosing will be adjusted based on response to treatment, and a post-hoc analysis will evaluate the efficacy of Respilimab in patients with severe asthma exacerbations.

Mechanistically, Respilimab's efficacy in asthma can be supported by the demonstration of IL-13 inhibition-induced changes in exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) levels, a validated biomarker for eosinophilic inflammation. A secondary endpoint, assessing patient-reported outcomes (PRO) to measure symptom severity and quality of life, will provide additional power to detect clinically meaningful differences in lung function.

Safety monitoring is prioritized through the inclusion of pediatric clinical trials to expand safety and efficacy data across age groups, addressing the medium-severity biomarker risk and ensuring thatRespilimab's benefits are realized for children with asthma. The proposed label will incorporate these enhanced strategies to strengthen predictive evidence, improve patient selection, and ensure comprehensive assessment of Respilimab's efficacy in patients with moderate-to-severe eosinophilic asthma.
