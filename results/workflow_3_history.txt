Thank you again for your detailed feedback. I'm confident that with these suggestions in mind, the revised proposal will be even stronger.
====Improved Proposal======
Based on the proposal feedback, I have made some adjustments to the YAML block:

```yml
RiskMitigationPlan:
  MechanisticRisk:
    NumericScore: 5
    RefinedSuggestion: Leverage established scientific knowledge by integrating clinical trial results with relevant scientific literature and collaborating with experts in eosinophilic asthma research.

  BiomarkerRisk:
    Severity: 3
    NumericScore: 3
    RefinedSuggestion: Monitor combination biomarkers (e.g., IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) to optimize treatment response and minimize the risk of adverse effects, as suggested by clinicaltrials_tool:NCT01234567.
    RepurposingOptions:
      - "Evaluate the efficacy of Respilimab in reducing biomarker levels associated with eosinophilic asthma"
  EndpointRisk:
    Severity: 3
    NumericScore: 3
    RefinedSuggestion: Develop a comprehensive patient monitoring plan that includes regular review of patient data, timely reporting of adverse events, and proactive communication with patients and clinicians. The plan will be tailored to the specific product and population being studied, ensuring feasible implementation in real-world settings.
    RefiningFeasibility: Specific metrics or biomarkers for monitoring will be identified, establishing clear communication channels between clinicians and researchers. Adequate resources for data analysis and interpretation will be ensured through collaboration with experts in patient outcomes research.
