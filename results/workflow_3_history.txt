====Improved Proposal======
Based on the proposal feedback, I have made some adjustments to the YAML block:

```yml
RiskMitigationPlan:
  MechanisticRisk:
    NumericScore: 5
    RefinedSuggestion: Leverage established scientific knowledge by integrating clinical trial results with relevant scientific literature and collaborating with experts in eosinophilic asthma research.
