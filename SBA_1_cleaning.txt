{{1.3 Summary of Clinical Pharmacology Findings}}
Pharmacokinetics
As stated in the label, steady-state mean concentration (Cmean) exposure was similar between 162 mg QW SC and 8 mg/kg IV Q4W regimens (Cmean of 48.6 and 58.4 mcg/mL, respectively). In comparison, trough concentrations were 2.4 times higher (44.6 versus 18.7 mcg/mL) and peak concentrations were 3 times lower (50.9 versus 154.7 mcg/mL) following 162 mg QW SC administration than following 8 mg/kg IV administration. The accumulation ratios for AUC, Cmin, and Cmax were 6.83, 6.37, and 5.47, respectively. Steady state was reached after 12 weeks for AUC, Cmin, and Cmax. All exposure values following 162 mg Q2W SC regimen (9.7, 12.3, and 5.6 mcg/mL for Cmean, peak concentration Cmax, and Ctrough, respectively) were less than half of those following 162 mg QW SC regimen. The accumulation ratios for AUC, Cmin, and Cmax were 2.67, 5.6, and 2.12, respectively. Steady state was reached after 12 weeks for AUC and Cmin, and after 10 weeks for Cmax. Therefore, steady-state TCZ PK exposure were more than dose-proportionally higher following SC QW regimen than following Q2W regimen, which can be explained by significant nonlinear elimination pathway at low TCZ concentrations.
A population PK analysis using data from the first 24-week dosing periods of two Phase III studies (WA22762 and NA25220) was analyzed to assess a two-compartment population PK model with parallel linear and Michaelis-Menten elimination and first order absorption following SC administration were used to describe TCZ concentrations. Based on the population PK analysis, the bioavailability of TCZ following SC administration for a typical patient was estimated to be 79.5% (95% CI: 77.9 – 81.1%). Following SC dosing in rheumatoid arthritis patients, the absorption half-life was around 3–5 days. The t1/2 of tocilizumab is concentration-dependent. For IV administration, the concentration-dependent apparent t1/2 is up to 11 days for 4 mg per kg and up to 13 days for 8 mg per kg every 4 weeks in patients with RA at steady-state. For SC administration, the concentration-dependent apparent t1/2 is up to 13 days for 162 mg every week and 5 days for 162 mg every other week in patients with RA at steady-state.
The developed model had the same structure (with addition of the parameters for bioavailability and absorption) and similar PK parameter values as the population PK model developed earlier based on only IV data, which indicates that there are no differences in PK between IV and SC formulations.
Among all covariate relationships for PK exposure (i.e., HDL-cholesterol on CL, total protein and albumin on volumes, normalized creatinine clearance on VM, age and study on ka, and injection site on bioavailability), body weight was identified as the single covariate that significantly influenced TCZ CL and volume parameters. Corresponding to a body weight range of 40 and 140 kg, CL decreased and increased respectively by 25% and 47%, and volumes decreased and increased respectively by 32% and 61% relative to the value corresponding to a patient weighing 70 kg.
Dose justification
Dose justification by the sponsor was relied partially on the developed PK exposure-DAS28 response model, but caveats should be given to interpret the results. The developed model led to the conclusion that the main driver for DAS28 response is TCZ exposure and no other variables have been identified as significant to impact efficacy response. However, two key demographic pieces of information, body weight and geographical region, were not evaluated during covariate model building for DAS28 response. It was observed that patients in the heaviest weight group (≥ 100 kg) and/or patients from in North America had the lowest efficacy responses for both the 162 mg SC QW and the 8 mg/kg IV Q4W regimens. It is also known that drug exposure is positively related to body weight following the 8 mg/kg IV Q4W regimen so less drug exposure in ≥ 100 kg body weight group cannot be used as the sole reason for the decreased efficacy. Further assessment of body weight and geographic region effect on DAS28 response is needed for a future generation of the model.
Based on Phase III study results, TCZ 162 mg SC QW and 8 mg/kg IV Q4W treatment regimens demonstrated comparable efficacy. The TCZ 162 SC Q2W dosing regimen also showed clinically superior efficacy improvements to placebo. However, the efficacy effect was less pronounced in the > 100 kg weight group for 162 kg SC Q2W treatment compared to same body weight groups for 162 kg SC QW and 8 mg/kg IV Q4W treatments (50.0%, 50.8%, 38.5%, and 27.3% for 162 mg SC QW, 162 mg SC Q2W, 8 mg/kg IV Q4W, and placebo for ACR20 responses, respectively, at Week 24 in ITT population). By directly comparing the ACR20 responses of patients weighting > 100 kg between SC QW and SC Q2W treatments (i.e., 50.0% vs. 38.5%), the decreased ACR responses for 162 mg SC Q2W treatment is likely to be associated with less drug exposure. In addition, it was reported that a substantial % of escape patients who escalated from the Q2W SC regimen to the QW SC regimen showed an improvement in efficacy. Therefore, dose escalation from SCQ2W to SC QW for patients weighting > 100 kg to gain therapeutic advantage is reasonable.
Clinical data supported the starting dosing regimen of 162 mg SC Q2W for patients weighting < 100 kg, mainly based on four reasons. First, the efficacy response in terms of ACR20 were observed to be > 60% for both SC QW and SC Q2W regimens for patients weighting < 100 kg. Second, a higher safety risk was observed across studies for SC QW than for SC Q2W in terms of % of patients with any AE and grades 1 & 2 neutropenia. The exposure–safety model also predicted higher grades 3 & 4 neutropenia risk for QW regimen. Third, overview of AEs leading to dose modifications/interruptions in studies WA22762 and NA25220 until Week 24 or clinical cutoff in safety population showed that the incidence of such events was higher in the SC QW treatment than in the SC Q2W treatment (27.3% vs. 13.5% at Week 24 and 36.1% vs. 16.7% at clinical cutoff) Starting from SC Q2W regimen may lend patients the opportunity for safety tolerance development to TCZ regimen and has the advantage of less dose modifications/interruptions. Fourth, the approved IV dosing regimen also recommends starting from a low dose of 4 mg/kg Q4W that can be escalated to 8 mg/kg Q4W based on clinical response.
In summary, the proposed dosing regimen for TCZ SC treatment seems reasonable.

{{2.2 General Clinical Pharmacology}}

{{2.2.1 What are the clinical pharmacology and clinical trials used to support the proposed claims?}}
This submission is primarily based on two pivotal phase III clinical trials in patients with RA (NA25220 and WA22762). As included in the submission, there are also a total of six clinical pharmacology studies that were designed to characterize the PK and PD profiles of TCZ following IV and SC administration and to evaluate the immunogenicity of TCZ when administered subcutaneously. Details of the clinical pharmacology studies are listed in Table 1 and the phase III studies including another study being conducted in Japan are listed in Table 2. Study schemes of WA22762 and NA25220 are exhibited in Figures 1 and 2, respectively. PK data for population PK analysis were derived from these two phase III trials (i.e., WA22762 and NA25220).

{{Figure 1x: Study scheme of WA22762 SUMMACTA Study}}
In the WA22762 study, patients underwent screening for up to 21 days before randomization. After screening, approximately 1200 patients were randomized equally into two groups:
Group A (N=600) received TCZ 162 mg subcutaneous (SC) once weekly (qw) combined with placebo intravenous (IV) every four weeks (q4w).
Group B (N=600) received TCZ 8 mg/kg IV q4w combined with placebo SC qw.
Following 24 weeks of double-blind treatment, a second randomization occurred at Week 24:
Group A1 (N=550) continued receiving TCZ 162 mg SC qw.
Group A2 (N=50) switched to TCZ 8 mg/kg IV q4w.
Group B1 (N=400) continued receiving TCZ 8 mg/kg IV q4w.
Group B2 (N=200) switched to TCZ 162 mg SC qw.
All groups then entered a 72-week open-label treatment period starting at Week 25. Patients either continued their initially assigned treatment or crossed over as specified.
This study design included a double-blind period for 24 weeks followed by a long-term open-label extension, allowing comparisons between IV and SC administration of TCZ. Stable background treatment with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) was maintained throughout the study.

{{Figure 2x: Study scheme of NA25220 BREVACTA Study}}
In the NA25220 study, patients also underwent screening for up to 21 days before randomization. A total of 600 patients were randomized into two groups:
Group A (N=400) received TCZ 162 mg SC every two weeks (q2w) using a prefilled syringe (PFS).
Group B (N=200) received placebo SC q2w (PFS).
For the first 24 weeks, patients remained in a double-blind treatment phase.
At Week 12, an escape therapy was available for both arms:
Patients with less than 20% improvement in swollen joint count (SJC) and tender joint count (TJC) from baseline were allowed to switch to escape treatment consisting of TCZ 162 mg SC qw.
Specifically, from baseline to Week 24, escape treatment involved switching to TCZ 162 mg SC qw via PFS. Post Week 24, escape treatment could be given either via PFS or auto-injector (AI).
At Week 24, a second randomization took place:
Group A1 (N=200) continued TCZ 162 mg SC q2w administered by auto-injector (AI).
Group A2 (N=200) continued TCZ 162 mg SC q2w administered by prefilled syringe (PFS).
Group B1 (N=100) switched to TCZ 162 mg SC q2w (AI).
Group B2 (N=100) switched to TCZ 162 mg SC q2w (PFS).
After Week 24, all patients entered a 72-week open-label treatment period, continuing their assigned administration method.
Following Week 48, for patients who still had less than 70% improvement in SJC and TJC compared to baseline, escape treatment with TCZ 162 mg SC qw could be initiated, regardless of administration method (PFS or AI).
Stable background treatment with DMARDs was maintained across both arms throughout the study.

{{2.2.2. Were the active moieties in the plasma appropriately identified and measured to assess pharmacokinetic parameters?}}
Concentrations of TCZ in human serum samples were determined by two different validated sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs): the Chugai PK assay and the Roche PK assay methods. In these assays, biotin-labeled interleukin soluble receptor (IL-6 sR) was bound to streptavidin-coated microtiter plates in the first step. TCZ in the sample was then bound to the immobilized biotin-labeled IL-6 sR. The bound TCZ could then be detected by digoxigenylated anti-TCZ antibodies, followed by an anti-DIG-POD (poly) conjugate and ABTS as a substrate.
The Chugai PK assay remained the same as used in the original Biologics License Application and Marketing Authorization Application (BLA125276) and was used in Study WP18097.
The primary assay for this submission (BLA125472) was the Roche assay. This Roche assay was first established and validated at SRL and was used for the Chugai studies MRA227JP and MRA229JP. It was also established and validated at (redacted).
The assay at (redacted) was used in Roche studies BP21894, BP22065, NP22623, NP25539, WA22762 (Week 24 and Long-Term Extension [LTE]) and NA25220 (Week 24 and LTE).
A summary of the assay performance during validation at (redacted) was as follows:
Assay Range: 100 to 3200 ng/mL.
Intra-assay accuracy ranged from 94.8% to 115.9%.
Inter-assay accuracy ranged from 95.3% to 109.2%.
Intra-assay precision ranged from 1.6% to 10.7%.
Inter-assay precision ranged from 5.3% to 9.2%.
The bioanalytical assays fulfilled the regulatory criteria according to the FDA guidance for industry titled "Bioanalytical Method Validation (Final-May 2001)", specifically the criteria that the precision and accuracy of the lowest quality control (QC) samples must not exceed 15% (20% for the lowest QC samples). Study samples were analyzed in runs containing calibrators and QC samples, following FDA recommendations.
The assay sensitivity, in terms of lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ), was 100 ng/mL for TCZ (concentration in native serum).

{{2.2.3 What are the PK characteristics of TCZ in RA patients following SC administration?}}
Concentrations of TCZ in human serum samples were determined by two different validated sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), the Chugai PK assay and Roche PK assay methods. Biotin-labeled interleukin soluble receptor (IL-6 sR) was bound to streptavidin coated microtiter plates in the first step. TCZ in the sample was bound to the immobilized biotin-labeled IL-6 sR. The bound TCZ can be detected by digoxigenylated anti-TCZ antibodies followed by an anti-DIG-POD (poly) conjugate and ABTS as a substrate.
The Chugai PK assay stayed the same as used in the original Biologics License Application and Marketing Authorization Application (BLA125276) and was used in Study WP18097. The main assay for this submission (BLA125472) was the Roche assay. This assay was first established and validated at SRL and was used for Chugai studies MRA227JP and MRA229JP. It was also established and validated at (redacted). The assay at (redacted) was used in Roche studies BP21894, BP22065, NP22623, NP25539, WA22762 (Week 24 and LTE) and NA25220 (Week 24 and LTE). The summary of the assay performance during assay validation at (redacted) is shown in Table 3.

Performance summary of the TCZ Roche PK Assay in serum from RA patients:
Validation Site: (redacted)
Assay Range, ng/mL: 100 to 3200
Accuracy, %:
Intra-Assay: 94.8 to 115.9
Inter-Assay: 95.3 to 109.2
Precision, %:
Intra-Assay: 1.6 to 10.7
Inter-Assay: 5.3 to 9.2
The bioanalytical assays fulfilled the regulatory criterion (refer to the FDA guidance for industry “Bioanalytical Method Validation (Final-May 2001)”) of not exceeding 15% (20% for the lowest quality control (QC) samples) for precision and accuracy. The accuracy and inter-day precision were acceptable (<15% bias or %CV). Study samples were analyzed in runs containing calibrators and QC samples, as recommended in the FDA guidance. The assay sensitivity in terms of LLOQ (lower limit of quantitation) was 100 ng/mL for TCZ (concentration in native serum).

{{2.2.3. What are the PK characteristics of TCZ in RA patients following SC administration?}}
TCZ bioavailability was estimated in healthy volunteers by dedicated studies (WP18097 and BP22065) and population PK analysis. By direct comparison of AUC’s following a single SC and IV dose of 160 mg, an estimate of absolute bioavailability of 56.5% was observed with study WP18097. As found in study BP22065, at a dose of 162 mg, the bioavailability after SC administration was 48.8%. At 81 mg of TCZ, the absolute bioavailability after SC administration was 22.7%. The increased bioavailability with increased dose reflected more than proportional increase in drug exposure at high SC doses. Therefore, given the nonlinear nature for TCZ clearance, all of these estimates must be taken with caution.
Based on population PK predictions, steady-state Cmean exposure was similar between 162 mg QW SC and 8 mg/kg IV Q4W regimens (Cmean of 48.6 and 58.4 mcg/mL, respectively). In comparison, trough concentrations were 2.4 times higher (44.6 versus 18.7 mcg/mL) and peak concentrations were 3 times lower (50.9 versus 154.7 mcg/mL) following 162 mg QW SC administration than following 8 mg/kg IV administration. All exposure values following 162 mg Q2W SC regimen (9.7, 12.3, and 5.6 mcg/mL for Cmean, peak concentration Cmax, and Ctrough, respectively) were less than half of those following 162 mg QW SC regimen. Therefore, steady-state TCZ PK exposures were more than dose-proportionally higher following QW SC regimen than following Q2W regimen, which can be explained by significant nonlinear elimination pathway at low tocilizumab concentrations.
A population PK analysis was conducted to study TCZ bioavailability and PK parameters. A total of 13,642 serum concentrations from 1759 patients from the first 24-week dosing periods of two Phase III studies (WA22762 and NA25220) were analyzed. A two-compartment population PK model with parallel linear and Michaelis-Menten elimination and first order absorption following SC administration were used to describe TCZ concentrations. Based on the population PK analysis, the bioavailability of TCZ following SC administration for a typical patient was estimated to be 79.5% (95% CI: 77.9 – 81.1%). The other estimates for key PK parameters include a linear portion of clearance (CL) of 0.216 L/day (95% CI: 0.211 - 0.221 L/day), a central volume of distribution (V2) of 4.51 L (95% CI: 4.37 - 4.65 L), an inter-compartmental clearance (Q) of 0.274 L/day (95% CI: 0.262 - 0.285 L/day), a peripheral volume of distribution (V3) of 2.77 L (95% CI: 2.68 - 2.87 L), a maximum elimination rate (VM) of 1.85 mg/L/day (95% CI: 1.82 - 1.89 mg/L/day), a Michaelis-Menten constant (KM) of 0.343 μg/mL (95% CI: 0.327 - 0.36 μg/mL), and an absorption rate constant (ka) of 0.233 day-1 (95% CI: 0.221 - 0.246 day-1). The developed model had the same structure (with addition of the parameters for bioavailability and absorption) and similar PK parameter values as the population PK model developed earlier based on only IV data, which indicates that there are no differences in PK between IV and SC formulations.
Among all covariate relationships for PK exposure (i.e., HDL-cholesterol on CL, total protein and albumin on volumes, normalized creatinine clearance on VM, age and study on ka, and injection site on bioavailability), body weight was identified as the single covariate that significantly influence TCZ CL and volume parameters. Corresponding to a body weight range of 40 and 140 kg, CL decreased and increased respectively by 25% and 47%, and volumes decreased and increased respectively by 32% and 61% relative to the value corresponding to a patient weighting 70 kg.

{{2.2.4. What are the PD characteristics of tocilizumab in patients?}}
Based on graphical analysis, it was observed that inflammation biomarkers CRP and ESR decreased with time and with increasing exposure; mechanism based biomarker sIL-6R levels increased with time and with increasing exposure. Post drug treatment, the between subject variability observed in CRP, ESR, and sIL-6R decrease with increasing exposure. Less pronounced effects were seen in CRP, ESR, and sIL-6R responses with the 162 mg SC Q2W regimen than the 162 mg SC QW regimen and 8 mg/kg IV Q4W regimens.

{{2.2.5. What are the key results from the population PK analysis?}}
See section 2.3.1.

{{2.2.6. Is the proposed dosing regimen justified?}}
The SC dose regimens for the two Phase III studies (WA22762 and NA25220) were determined based on the PK, PD, and safety data from two Phase I/II studies (i.e., MRA227JP and NP22623) in patients with RA. Based on these two study results, it was found that the PD profiles (CRP, ESR, and sIL-6R) corresponding to the TCZ162 mg SC QW regimen were most comparable to those following the 8 mg/kg TCZ IV Q4W regimen. In comparison, the 162 mg SC Q2W regimen led to slower and less pronounced PD responses than 8 mg/kg IV Q4W and 162 mg SC QW regimens. However, the PD responses following the 162 mg SC Q2W regimen were superior to the 81 mg SC Q2W and QW regimens.
Although dose justification by sponsor was partially relied on the developed PK exposure-DAS28 response model, caveats should be given to interpret the results. The developed PK exposure-DAS28 response model led to the conclusion that the main driver for DAS28 response is TCZ exposure and no other variables have been identified as significant to impact efficacy response. However, two key demographic information, body weight and region, were not evaluated during covariate model building for DAS28 response. It was observed that patients in the heaviest weight group (>=100 kg) and/or patients from in North America had the lowest efficacy responses for both the 162 mg SC QW and the 8 mg/kg IV Q4W regimens. It is also known that drug exposure is positively related to body weight following the 8 mg/kg IV Q4W regimen so less drug exposure in >=100 kg body weight group cannot be used as the sole reason for the decreased efficacy. Further assessment of body weight and geographic region effect on DAS28 response is needed for a future generation of the model.
Based on Phase III study results, TCZ 162 mg SC QW and 8 mg/kg IV Q4W treatment regimens demonstrated comparable efficacy. The TCZ 162 SC Q2W dosing regimen also showed clinically superior efficacy improvements to placebo. However, the efficacy effect was less pronounced in the >100 kg weight group for 162 kg SC Q2W treatment compared to same body weight groups for 162 kg SC QW and 8 mg/kg IV Q4W treatments (50.0%, 50.8%, 38.5%, and 27.3% for 162 mg SC QW, 162 mg SC Q2W, 8 mg/kg IV Q4W, and placebo in terms of ACR20 responses, respectively, at Week 24 in ITT population). By directly comparing the ACR20 responses of patients weighting >100 kg between SC QW and SC Q2W treatments (i.e., 50.0 % vs. 38.5%), the decreased ACR responses for 162 mg SC Q2W treatment is likely to be associated with less drug exposure. In addition, it was reported that a substantial % of escape patients who escalated from the Q2W SC regimen to the QW SC regimen showed an improvement in efficacy. Therefore, dose escalation from SCQ2W to SC QW for patients weighting >100 kg to gain therapeutic advantage is reasonable.
Clinical data supported the starting dosing regimen of 162 mg SC Q2W for patients weighting <100 kg, mainly based on four reasons. First, the efficacy response in terms of ACR20 were observed to be >60% for both SC QW and SC Q2W regimens for patients weighting <100 kg. Second, a higher safety risk was observed across studies for SC QW than for SC Q2W in terms of % of patients with any AE and grades 1 & 2 neutropenia. The exposure–safety model also predicted higher grades 3 & 4 neutropenia risk for QW regimen. Third, overview of AEs leading to dose modifications/ interruptions in studies WA22762 and NA25220 until Week 24 or clinical cutoff in safety population showed that the incidence of such events was higher in the SC QW treatment than in the SC Q2W treatment (27.3% vs. 13.5% at Week 24 and 36.1% vs. 16.7% at clinical cutoff). Starting from SC Q2W regimen may lend the opportunity to patients for safety tolerance development to TCZ regimen and has the advantage of less dose modifications/interruptions. Fourth, the approved IV dosing regimen also recommends starting from a low dose of 4 mg/kg Q4W that can be escalated to 8 mg/kg Q4W based on clinical response.
In summary, the proposed dosing regimen for TCZ SC treatment seems reasonable. Refer to the appended pharmacometric report for additional dose justification details and the review by Dr. Miya Patentti, Medical Officer, DPARP, for further information regarding effectiveness/safety of the tested doses.

{{2.3 Intrinsic Factors}}

{{2.3.1. What was the impact of demographic covariates on TCZ exposure?}}
Body weight was identified as the single covariate that significantly influenced TCZ CL and volume parameters. Corresponding to a body weight range of 40 and 140 kg, CL decreased and increased respectively by 25% and 47%, and volumes decreased and increased respectively by 32% and 61% relative to the value corresponding to a patient weighting 70 kg. The other covariate-exposure relationships identified, which only had insignificant effect on PK profile, include HDL-cholesterol on CL, total protein and albumin on volumes, normalized creatinine clearance on VM, age and study on ka, and injection site on bioavailability. The findings are consistent with population PK models developed for IV formulation, where another body size measure, body surface area (BSA), had been identified as the most influential covariate for TCZ exposure.
Refer to the appended pharmacometric report for additional dose justification details.

{{2.3.2. What were the immunogenicity findings for TCZ? What was the impact of immunogenicity on exposure, efficacy, and/or safety?}}
Consistent with immunogenicity (IM) rate reported for TCZ IV, the overall immunogenicity rate for TCZ SC was low (~1%). As inferred from population PK analysis based on two Phase III study data (WA22762 and NA25220), the linear portion of clearance has no appreciable difference between anti-TCZ antibody positive and negative patients. In the population exposure–response analyses of the relationships between exposure and DAS28 and between exposure and neutrophil count, neutralizing anti-TCZ antibodies were not identified as an covariate influencing both TCZ efficacy and safety.

{APPENDIX}

{{1 SUMMARY OF FINDINGS}}

{{1.1 Key Review Questions}}
The purpose of this review is to address the following key questions.

{{1.1.1 What are the main population PK findings for tocilizumab TCZ dose/dosing regimen in rheumatoid arthritis RA patients following subcutaneous SC administration?}}
Among all the covariates explored, body weight was identified as the only significant covariate on TCZ clearance and volume of distribution. Based on the final model, patients weighing 40 and 140 kg are associated with decreased and increased clearance (CL) by 25% and 43%, respectively, compared to a patient weighing 70 kg. Moreover, volume of distribution (VD) decreased and increased by 32% and 61% respectively, compared to a patient weighing 70 kg. These covariate findings support the weight-derived dosing regimen.
A developed 2-compartment population PK (popPK) model adequately described the time course of serum TCZ concentration following SC administration in subjects with active RA. In the model, total CL is the sum of both linear (concentration-independent) and nonlinear (concentration-dependent) components. For the linear elimination pathway, a mean CL of around 9 mL/h was estimated from the final popPK model. The nonlinear elimination pathway of TCZ is believed to describe a target-mediated clearance process due to the binding to the target IL-6R. It was estimated that a linear PK profile will be observed at TCZ serum concentrations of > 40 μg/mL. The saturation of the nonlinear elimination pathway was more pronounced with the 162 mg QW SC and the 8 mg/kg Q4W IV regimen, resulting in less variation of total clearance over the dosing interval at steady-state compared to 162 mg Q2W SC dosing. Due to the dependence of total clearance on TCZ serum concentrations, the half-life of TCZ is also concentration-dependent. Based on the popPK model, an effective half-life was estimated for TCZ serum concentrations at steady-state. During an inter-dose interval at steady state, the effective steady state half-life of TCZ was found to be between 12.1 and 13.0 days for the 162 mg SC QW regimen and between 1.8 and 4.9 days for 162 mg SC Q2W regimen and between 6.6 and 18.6 days for 8 mg/kg IV Q4W regimen, based on the predicted concentration range at terminal phase. Following TCZ SC administration, the absorption half-life was estimated to be between 4 to 5 days and the bioavailability of TCZ was estimated to be 79.5% (95%CI: 77.9 – 81.1%).
The final PK model based on data from Studies NA25220 and WA22762 retained the effects of weight and HDL-cholesterol on CL; weight, total protein and albumin on central and peripheral volumes; normalized creatinine clearance on Vmax; age and study on ka; and injection site on bioavailability. The covariate effect on exposure was assessed by referring to the observed range and the results were demonstrated in Figure 1.

{{Figure 1: Covariate Effects on TCZ Clearance}}
The figure shows a forest plot illustrating the effect of different covariates on tocilizumab clearance (CL), with a reference patient being a 70 kg female, 50 years old, albumin 35 g/L, HDL 1.5 g/L, RF 150 IU/mL.
Weight has the strongest effect:
A patient weighing 40 kg had lower clearance compared to the reference.
A patient weighing 140 kg had higher clearance.
HDL cholesterol levels (both low at 0.75 mmol/L and high at 3.5 mmol/L) had minor effects on clearance compared to weight.
The shaded area in the plot represents no or minimal change from the reference patient (centered around a value of 1.0).
Clearance shifts are proportional to body weight but minimally impacted by HDL variations.
Overall: Body weight has a major impact on TCZ clearance, whereas HDL levels have a relatively minor influence.

{{1.1.2 What is the rationale behind the proposed tocilizumab (TCZ) dose/dosing regimen in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients following subcutaneous (SC) administration?}}
The following shows the proposed TCZ dosing regimen in patients with RA:
Patients less than 100 kg weight: 162 mg administered subcutaneously every other week, followed by an increase to every week based on clinical response.
Patients at or above 100 kg weight: 162 mg administered subcutaneously every week.
The SC dose regimens for the two Phase III studies (studies WA22762 and NA25220) were determined based on the PK, PD, and safety data from two Phase I/II studies (i.e., MRA227JP and NP22623) in patients with RA. Based on these two study results, it was found that the PD profiles (e.g., CRP, ESR, and sIL-6R) corresponding to the TCZ162 mg SC QW regimen were most comparable to those following the 8 mg/kg TCZ IV Q4W regimen. In comparison, the 162 mg SC Q2W regimen led to slower and less pronounced PD responses than 8 mg/kg IV Q4W and 162 mg SC QW regimens. However, the PD responses following the 162 mg SC Q2W regimen were superior to the 81 mg SC Q2W and QW regimens. Both a population PK model and exposure-response models for both efficacy and safety have been used to justify the SC dosing regimen.
Although dose justification by sponsor was partially relied on the developed PK exposure-DAS28 response model, caveats should be given to interpret the results. The developed PK exposure-DAS28 response model led to the conclusion that the main driver for DAS28 response is TCZ exposure and no other variables have been identified as significant to impact efficacy response. However, two key demographic information, body weight and region, were not evaluated during covariate model building for DAS28 response. It was observed that patients in the heaviest weight group (>=100 kg) and/or patients from in North America had the lowest efficacy responses for both the 162 mg SC QW and the 8 mg/kg IV Q4W regimens. It is also known that drug exposure is positively related to body weight following the 8 mg/kg IV Q4W regimen so less drug exposure in >=100 kg body weight group cannot be used as the sole reason for the decreased efficacy. Further assessment of body weight and geographic region effect on DAS28 response is needed for a future generation of the model.
Based on Phase III study results, TCZ 162 mg SC QW and 8 mg/kg IV Q4W treatment regimens demonstrated comparable efficacy. The TCZ 162 SC Q2W dosing regimen also showed clinically superior efficacy improvements to placebo. However, the efficacy effect was less pronounced in the > 100 kg weight group for 162 kg SC Q2W treatment compared to same body weight groups for162 kg SC QW and 8 mg/kg IV Q4W treatments (50.0%, 50.8%, 38.5%, and 27.3% for 162 mg SC QW, 162 mg SC Q2W, 8 mg/kg IV Q4W, and placebo in terms of ACR20 responses, respectively, at Week 24 in ITT population). By directly comparing the ACR20 responses of patients weighting > 100 kg between SC QW and SC Q2W treatments (i.e., 50.0 % vs. 38.5%), the decreased ACR responses for 162 mg SC Q2W treatment is likely to be associated with less drug exposure. In addition, it was reported that a substantial % of escape patients who escalated from the Q2W SC regimen to the QW SC regimen showed an improvement in efficacy. Therefore, dose escalation from SCQ2W to SC QW for patients weighting > 100 kg to gain therapeutic advantage is reasonable.
Clinical data supported the starting dosing regimen of 162 mg SC Q2W for patients weighting <100 kg, mainly based on four reasons. First, the efficacy response in terms of ACR20 were observed to be >60% for both SC QW and SC Q2W regimens for patients weighting < 100 kg. Second, higher safety risk were observed across studies for SC QW than for SC Q2W in terms of % of patients with any AE and grades 1 & 2 neutropenia. The exposure–safety model also predicted higher grades 3 & 4 neutropenia risk for QW regimen. Third, overview of AEs leading to dose modifications/ interruptions in studies WA22762 and NA25220 until Week 24 or clinical cutoff in safety population showed that the incidence of such events was higher in the SC QW treatment than in the SC Q2W treatment (27.3% vs. 13.5% at Week 24 and 36.1% vs. 16.7% at clinical cutoff). Starting from SC Q2W regimen may lend patients the opportunity for safety tolerance development to TCZ regimen and has the advantage of less dose modifications/interruptions. Fourth, the approved IV dosing regimen also recommends starting from a low dose of 4 mg/kg Q4W that can be escalated to 8 mg/kg Q4W based on clinical response.
In summary, the proposed dosing regimen for TCZ SC treatment seems reasonable.

{{2 RESULTS OF SPONSOR’S ANALYSIS}}
{{2.1 Population PK analysis}}
{{2.1.1 Analysis Dataset}}
The population PK database included dosing, PK and covariate data from the Phase III studies, WA22762 and NA25220. There were 13,642 samples from 1759 patients used in the analysis with the combined dataset.
{{2.1.2 Model building}}
The structural popPK model is an empirical two-compartment PK model with a first-order absorption to describe SC administration and both parallel linear and Michaelis-Menten eliminations. The nonlinear elimination pathway of tocilizumab was believed to represent a target-mediated clearance process due to the binding to IL-6R. Nonlinear mixed-effect modeling was conducted using NONMEM (version 7.2.0).
By engaging prior learnings from the popPK model for TCZ IV, a covariate modeling approach emphasizing parameter estimation rather than stepwise hypothesis testing was used for covariate selection. A full model was established by incorporating potential covariate-parameter relationships identified based on prior learning, mechanistic plausibility, and exploratory graphics. The full model did not initially include strongly correlated or collinear covariates. Additional exploratory diagnostics for the full covariate model was conducted by graphical exploration of all measured covariate effects and the model was revised when necessary. The relationships suggested by the diagnostic plots of the base model were also tested.
The effects of continuous covariates were modeled using a normalized power model while the effects of binary covariates were modeled by factor multiplication.
In summary, weight, BSA, sex, age, albumin, rheumatoid factor, and HDL-cholesterol were considered for CL; weight, BSA, sex, age, albumin, and total protein for central and peripheral volumes; age, injection site, weight, and BMI for absorption rate constant; injection site, weight, and BMI for bioavailability; albumin, normalized creatinine clearance, and smoking for VM constant. The base and covariate models developed with the dataset from Study WA22762 were updated, after performing external validation with dataset from Study NA25220, using the pooled dataset from Studies WA22762 and NA25220.

{{Reviewer’s comment}} no formal covariate selection procedure has been implemented for the popPK model for TCZ SC. However, given the model building procedure and validation for the popPK model for TCZ IV and the various model validation techniques used for the popPK model for TCZ SC, the model building procedure implemented for TCZ SC is reasonable.

{{2.1.3 Model evaluation}}
The developed models were extensively evaluated by basic graphical evaluations, ETA shrinkage, and predictive checks.
Basic graphical evaluations included graphical plots checking Observed Concentrations (DV) vs predicted concentrations (Population prediction (PRED), individual predictions (IPRED)), residual plots (conditional weighted residuals (CWRES), individual weighted residuals (IWRES) vs predictions and time), histograms and quantile-quantile plots (conditional weighted residuals and individual random effects (IIV)), plots for individual random effects (intercorrelations and relationship to covariates).
For ETA shrinkage, the shrinkage percent for random effect ηᵢ is calculated by the following equation:
Shrinkageᵢ = 100 × (1 - SDᵢ / √Ω(i,i))
where:
SDᵢ is the standard deviation of the individual random effects estimates
Ω(i,i) is the corresponding diagonal term of the random effects variance-covariance matrix estimated by the model.
The employed predictive check procedures include Visual Predictive Check (VPC), Predictive Check Simulations (PCS) for the trough concentrations at week 24, Standardized Visual Predictive Check (SVPC), and Normalized Prediction Distribution Errors (NPDE).

{{2.1.4 Results}}
In summary, the developed two-compartment population PK model adequately characterized the time course of serum TCZ concentration following SC administration in subjects with active RA, as supported by all model evaluation approaches employed. In the model, total CL was defined as the sum of both a linear (concentration-independent) component and a nonlinear (concentration-dependent) component.
Based on the final model, a mean linear CL was estimated to be ~9 mL/h. The nonlinear elimination pathway of TCZ was believed to reflect the target-mediated clearance process as a result of TCZ binding to IL-6R. Based on the final model, it was expected that the linear PK profile be apparent at TCZ serum concentrations of >40 μg/mL. Therefore, the saturation of the nonlinear elimination pathway was more pronounced for the 162 mg SC QW and 8 mg/kg IV Q4W regimen, resulting in less variation of total clearance and thus drug exposure over the dosing interval at steady-state compared to 162 mg SC Q2W dosing regimen. It was also expected that the half-life of TCZ be also concentration-dependent, given target mediated drug clearance and the dependence of total drug clearance on TCZ serum concentrations. Based on estimations from the model simulations, the effective steady state half-life of TCZ was found to be between 1.8 and 4.9 days, between 12.1 and 13.0 days, and between 6.6 and 18.6 for 162 mg SC Q2W, 162 mg SC QW regimen, and 8 mg/kg IV Q4W regimen, respectively, based on their concentration range in the terminal phase. Following TCZ SC administration, the absorption half-life was estimated to be between 4 to 5 days. The bioavailability of TCZ following SC administration was estimated to be 79.5% (95%CI: 77.9 – 81.1%).
Based on model simulations, PK parameters following different SC regimens were simulated. For the 162 mg every week dose, the estimated mean (±SD) steady-state AUC1week, Cmin and Cmax of tocilizumab were 8200 ± 3600 mcg•h/mL, 44.6 ± 20.6 mcg/mL, and 50.9 ± 21.8 mcg/mL, respectively. The accumulation ratios for AUC, Cmin, and Cmax were 6.83, 6.37, and 5.47, respectively. Steady state was reached after 12 weeks for AUC, Cmin, and Cmax. For the 162 mg every other week dose, the estimated mean (±SD) steady-state AUC2week, Cmin, and Cmax of TCZ were 3200 ± 2700 mcg•h/mL, 5.6 ± 7.0 mcg/mL, and 12.3 ± 8.7 mcg/mL, respectively. The accumulation ratios for AUC, Cmin, and Cmax were 2.67, 5.6, and 2.12, respectively. Steady state was reached after 12 weeks for AUC and Cmin, and after 10 weeks for Cmax.
The final PK model retained the effects of weight and HDL-cholesterol on CL; weight, total protein and albumin on central and peripheral volumes; normalized creatinine clearance on VM; age and study on ka; and injection site on bioavailability. PK parameters associated with the final model is shown in Table 1. The covariate effect on exposure was assessed by referring to the observed range and the results were demonstrated in Table 2 and Figure 2. Among all identified covariate relationships body weight was identified as the only significant covariate on TCZ clearance and volume of distribution. Based on the final model, patients weighting 40 and 140 kg are associated with decreased and increased CL by 25% and 43%, and are associated with volume of distributions decreased and increased respectively by 32% and 61% respectively, compared to a patient weighting 70 kg. The negative correlation between body weight and drug exposure was verified by exploratory analysis as demonstrated by Figure 3.
Simulations based on the final model were conducted to derive PK exposure parameters based on dosing regimen and body weight (<60 kg, 60-100 kg, and >= 100 kg). Summary statistics of predicted individual steady-state exposure parameters were shown in Table 3.

{{Table 2: Predicted Covariate Effect by the Final Model}}
The final population PK model predicted the covariate effects on key pharmacokinetic parameters for tocilizumab (TCZ) as follows:
Clearance (CL):
Weight (kg), across a range of 34.4 to 149 kg, with 70 kg as the reference:
At 40 kg, the clearance was reduced by -24.9% (95% CI: -26.8% to -22.9%).
At 140 kg, clearance increased by 42.6% (95% CI: 38% to 47.2%).
HDL (mmol/L), across a range of 0.31 to 4.46 mmol/L, with 1.5 mmol/L as the reference:
At 0.75 mmol/L, clearance increased by 19.4% (95% CI: 15% to 24.1%).
At 3.5 mmol/L, clearance decreased by -19.5% (95% CI: -23.2% to -15.7%).
Central and Peripheral Volume of Distribution (V₂, V₃):
Weight (kg), across 34.4 to 149 kg, reference 70 kg:

{{Figure 2: Covariate effects on TCZ clearance}}
The figure titled "Covariate Effects on Tocilizumab Clearance" illustrates the impact of covariates on the clearance (CL) of tocilizumab (TCZ). The reference patient characteristics for comparison are:
Female
Weight 70 kg
Age 50 years
Albumin 35 g/L
HDL 1.5 g/L
RF (rheumatoid factor) 150 IU/mL
The reference typical clearance value for this patient is 0.216 L/day.
The graph shows the relative change in clearance compared to the reference patient, based on specific covariates:
Weight 40 kg is associated with a lower clearance relative to the reference.
Weight 140 kg is associated with a higher clearance relative to the reference
HDL 0.75 mmol/L is associated with an increased clearance relative to the reference.
HDL 3.5 mmol/L is associated with a decreased clearance relative to the reference.
The horizontal axis measures the change in parameter relative to the reference patient, ranging approximately from 0.2 to 1.5.
The shaded vertical region on the plot represents no significant change (centered around a value of 1.0), which indicates no covariate effect.
Points falling outside this shaded area indicate a meaningful change in clearance.
Thus, body weight has a substantial influence on TCZ clearance, with low body weight (40 kg) significantly decreasing clearance and high body weight (140 kg) significantly increasing clearance.HDL levels also impact clearance, but to a lesser extent than body weight.

{{Figure 3: Observed Ctrough at Week 24 versus Body Weight at Week 20}}
This figure displays the relationship between body weight and tocilizumab (TCZ) trough concentration (Ctrough) at Week 24 in patients from two dosing groups, with weight measured at Week 20.
The x-axis represents body weight in kilograms (kg), ranging from approximately 32 kg to 152 kg.
The y-axis represents the observed TCZ Ctrough concentration in μg/mL, ranging from 0 to 161 μg/mL.
The plot includes two groups:
Open circles (◯) represent patients treated with TCZ 162 mg SC once weekly (QW) plus DMARD (N=488).
Filled circles (●) represent patients treated with TCZ 8 mg/kg IV every 4 weeks (Q4W) plus DMARD (N=493).
The Pearson correlation coefficients (r) are provided for each group:
For TCZ 162 mg SC QW, r = -0.140, indicating a weak negative correlation between body weight and Ctrough.
For TCZ 8 mg/kg IV Q4W, r = -0.122, also indicating a weak negative correlation.
Overall, the figure shows that:
Higher body weight is associated with a lower TCZ trough concentration for both dosing regimens.
The negative correlation is relatively weak but present in both subgroups.
Patients with lower body weights tend to have higher observed TCZ concentrations at Week 24.
This observation supports that body weight influences TCZ exposure, and that heavier patients may achieve lower drug concentrations even with weight-adjusted or fixed dosing regimens.

{{2.2 Exposure-efficacy response DAS28 analysis}}

{{2.2.1 Analysis Dataset}}
The dataset for exposure-response analysis contained DAS28 measurements from a total of 1890 subjects (i.e., 9430 DAS28 measurements from 1250 subjects of study WA22762 and 4568 measurements from 640 subjects of study NA25220). Among the 1890 subjects, 629, 621, 353, and 126 subjects received 8 mg/kg Q4W IV, 162 mg QW SC, 162 mg Q2W SC, or placebo TCZ doses, respectively; 90 and 71 subjects received placebo or 162 mg Q2W SC doses for 12 weeks, respectively, but escaped after week 12 by switching to 162 mg TCZ QW SC dosing regimen. DAS28 data were not available after week 12 for the majority of escaped subjects.

{{2.2.2 Model building}}
The time-course of DAS28 was described by an indirect-response model with inhibition of production rate driven by serum TCZ concentrations, which was also used to model the time-course of DAS28 following IV administration. TCZ was assumed to inhibit ‘production’ of DAS28 via an Emax function.
Full model with backward elimination was used to identify the final covariate model. Potential covariate-parameter relationships were identified based on scientific interest, mechanistic plausibility, and exploratory graphics, and were incorporated into the full model simultaneously with the notion not to include strongly correlated or collinear covariates. The full model development was also assisted by the additional graphical exploration of the measured covariate values vs estimates of individual random effects from the full model. During backward elimination, (1) precisely estimated covariates with clinically insignificant effects and (2) covariates with effects close to null value and/or with high relative standard error and/or with the 95% confidence intervals that included the null value were excluded from the final model. Increase of objective function value by less than 10.83 at a single covariate elimination was used as a criterion to exclude covariates, which was equivalent to eliminate covariates associated with wide covariate effect confidence intervals that were not statistically significant at α=0.001 level.
The following covariates were screened for their effects on efficacy: gender, age, baseline C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL6, previous treatment with corticosteroids (PCOR), baseline values of health assessment questionnaire (HAQ), patient’s assessment of pain (PAIN), and physicians global score of disease activity (VASP) on the baseline value of DAS28; gender, age, baseline CRP, and PCOR on the first order elimination rate of DAS28 (kout in model); gender, age, and baseline CRP and IL6 on the TCZ concentration at which 50% of the maximum effect is reached (EC50 in model) and LEmax (LEmax defined with a relation to maximum drug effect Emax with a relation Emax=1/(1+LEmax) in model); and baseline IL6 on the background effect of cocomitant DMARD therapies expressed in TCZ concentration equivalents (CDMARD). The rationale for exploring these covariates was based on clinical importance, mechanistic plausibility, and prior knowledge from the previous analysis.

{{2.2.3 Model evaluation}}
The developed models were extensively evaluated by basic graphical evaluations, ETA shrinkage, and predictive checks.
Basic graphical evaluations included graphical plots checking Observed DAS28 values (DV) vs predicted concentrations (Population prediction (PRED), individual predictions (IPRED)) and time, residual plots (absolute conditional weighted residuals, individual weighted residuals (IWRES) vs predictions and time), histograms and quantile-quantile plots (conditional weighted residuals and individual random effects (IIV)), plots for individual random effects (intercorrelations and relationship to covariates) and their distribution plots stratified by the categorical covariates.
For ETA shrinkage, the shrinkage percent for each random random effect ηᵢ is calculated by the following equation:
Shrinkageᵢ = 100 × (1 - SDᵢ / √Ω(i,i))
where:
SDᵢ is the standard deviation of the individual random effects estimates
Ω(i,i) is the corresponding diagonal term of the random effects variance-covariance matrix estimated by the model.
The precision of parameter estimates were provided for each of the parameters and non-parametric bootstrap procedure is employed due to long run time for each iteration. The employed predictive check procedures include Visual Predictive Check (VPC), Predictive Check Simulations (PCS), Standardized Visual Predictive Check (SVPC), and Normalized Prediction Distribution Errors (NPDE).

{{2.2.4 Results}}
Based on the report (Exposure-Efficacy Analyses of TCZ of Phase III Studies WA22762 and NA25220 in Rheumatoid Arthritis), the indirect-response model with an inhibitory effect on DAS28 ‘production’ rate by TCZ serum concentrations was used to describe the magnitude and the time-course of DAS28 score reduction. The model supported the observation that the 8 mg/kg IV Q4W and 162 mg SC QW dosing regimens have similar efficacy. Both the 8 mg/kg IV Q4W and 162 mg SC QW dosing regimens are also more efficacious than the 162 mg SC Q2W dosing regimen.
Based on the final model, the population mean of the maximum effect of TCZ corresponds to 56.5% reduction of DAS28 from baseline. The relationship between TCZ concentration and DAS28 is independent of the route of administration (i.e., IV vs SC). No covariate was found to have a clinical impact on the effect of TCZ on DAS28.
The covariates that remained in the final model are as follows: baseline values of CRP, HAQ, VASP, and PAIN for DAS28 values at baseline (BASE parameter) with positive relationships, which is in line with the fact that all these covariates are markers of RA disease activity; gender for the maximum effect of tocilizumab (Emax) with higher Emax in males; and age and baseline IL6 for Emax with positive relationships. These findings are consistent with the exposure-efficacy response analysis that focused based on IV data. The final model passed the model evaluation assessment as described in previous section.

To evaluate the covariate effects on DAS28 response (gender, age, baseline CRP, and baseline IL6), simulations were performed to predict the time courses of DAS28 corresponding to different covariate levels. It was found that males and younger patients tended to have slightly lower DAS28 levels. Subjects with high baseline CRP tended to have significantly higher baseline DAS28 scores. However, the simulation results predicted that the difference in DAS28 levels for different baseline CRP groups disappeared after about 10 weeks of dosing for the 162 mg SC QW and 8 mg/kg IV Q4W regimens. In comparison, the DAS28 difference remained almost constant throughout the course of treatment for the 162 mg SC Q2W regimen. A slightly higher DAS28 scores was observed for subjects with higher IL6 levels but the DAS28 scores decreased to the same levels as in subjects with low baseline IL6 after 4-5 weeks for the 162 mg SC QW and 8 mg/kg IV Q4W regimens.
Overall, except for baseline CRP level for 162 mg SC Q2W regimen, the rest of covariate effects on DAS28 projections were found to be small based on sponsor’s analysis.
Simulations were performed based on the final model for the DAS28 time-course for a 24 week treatment schedule. The simulated DAS28 profiles for three active treatments are shown in Figure 4. It showed that DAS28 scores steadily decrease after a rapid drop during the first 8 weeks. The responses to TCZ regimens of 8 mg/kg IV Q4W and 162 mg SC QW were comparable and the response was relatively smaller for 162 mg SC Q2W regimen.

{{Figure 4: Simulated DAS28 over Time, by Dosing Regimen}}

Key observations:
All dosing regimens show a sharp initial drop in DAS28 scores over the first 8 weeks, followed by a gradual plateau.
162 mg SC QW and 8 mg/kg IV Q4W regimens produced comparable decreases in DAS28 scores over time.
Their medians overlap substantially during treatment.
The 162 mg SC Q2W regimen shows a lesser reduction in DAS28 scores compared to the other two regimens.
Patients in the Q2W group maintain higher median DAS28 scores throughout the treatment period.
Prediction intervals (dashed lines) indicate the variability within each dosing group, showing the spread between the 5th and 95th percentiles.
Overall Interpretation:
Weekly SC dosing and IV every 4 weeks dosing were similarly effective in reducing DAS28.
Every-2-week SC dosing resulted in slightly poorer clinical response.
Variability across patients was largest during the first weeks and stabilized thereafter.

{{Reviewer’s comment}}
The relationship between exposure (Ctrough) and efficacy response in terms of ACR responses were also evaluated separately. As shown in Table 4, ACR20/50/70 response rates was summarized by the four exposure quartiles for 8mg/kg IV, 162 mg SC QW and Q2W dose regimens. For the 162 mg Q2W SC treatment, there was an overall trend for an increase in the ACR response rate of any type with increased Ctrough. For the QW SC treatment, similar pattern was observed for ACR20 response but with a lesser extent. In contrast, the response rates of ACR 50 and 70 seemed to reach plateau level after the second Ctrough quartile. For the 8 mg/kg Q4W IV treatment, no clear trend toward a greater response with increasing exposure was observed. exposure as measured by Ctrough was observed. These findings indicate a clear exposure –efficacy response relationship for the 162 mg TCZ SC Q2W dosing.  

In the reviewer’s opinion, Ctrough cannot be used as a universal TCZ PK exposure measure for ACR response and it as a measure of drug exposure should be interpreted in combination with dosing frequency (i.e., SC Q2W, SC QW, or IV Q4W ) and route of administration (i.e., IV vs. SC). As shown by Table 4, higher Ctrough levels associated with a particular dosing frequency and/or route of administration could correspond to lower ACR responses compared to lower Ctrough levels associated with other dosing frequencies and/or route of administration.  For example, the mean Q3 Ctrough of 7.6 μg/ml associated with TCZ SC Q2W and the mean Q1 Ctrough of 4.1 μg/ml associated with TCZ IV Q4W were about 50% and 30% of the Q1 Ctrough of 14.6 μg/ml associated with TCZ SC QW, respectively. However, the ACR responses associated with the Q3 exposure of SC Q2W and Q1 exposure of IV Q4W were significantly higher than ones associated with the Q1 exposure of SC QW. Therefore, TCZ Ctrough only reflects the relative drug exposure within the same dosing frequency and dosing regimen. Caveat should be given when interpret Ctrough as an overall PK exposure measure. 
In the exposure-DAS28 response model, the contemporary TCZ serum concentration, instead of Ctrough, is used as a dynamic PK exposure input as the efficacy driver. This is in line with the reviewer’s opinion that Ctrough cannot be used as a universal PK exposure measure for efficacy response.  
The model predicted the main driver for DAS28 response is TCZ exposure and no other variables were identified as significant. Two key pieces of demographic information that the reviewer feels are important, body weight and region, were not evaluated during covariate model building.  
As indicated in subgroup analyses in the study report, although the proportion of patients achieving an ACR20 response was similar between arms within the regions and body weight groups, ACR responses differed either between regions (i.e., North America, South America, Europe, and the rest of world) or between body weight groups (<60 kg, 60-100 kg, and 
>=100 kg). Patients in the heaviest weight group (>=100 kg) and/or patients from in North America had the lowest responses for both the 162 mg SC QW and the 8 mg/kg IV Q4W regimens (Table 5 and Table 6). 

As shown in Table 5, a lower ACR20 response rate of 51% was observed in the >=100 kg body weight group than the rates of 71-76% in the other two weight groups following the 8 mg/kg IV Q4W  treatment regimen. It has been found that drug exposure of patients with high body weight was relatively higher than drug exposure of patients with low body weight following 8 mg/kg IV dosing (Table 3). The finding of relatively lower ACR20 response rate for patients weighting >=100 kg following TCZ IV administration cannot be supported by lower drug exposure and is likely to be related to high body weight and/or geographic region.  In addition, no strong collinearity relations were identified between body weight and other covariates such as baseline levels of CRP, Age, IL6, DAS28 that were evaluated in the model building process (Figure 5). Therefore, potential relationship between body weight and efficacy response cannot be fully assessed. 
Taking all considerations into account, caveats should be given to interpret the exposure-efficacy response as proposed given high correlation between DAS28 and ACR20 scores.  Future model refinement needs to assess the impact of body weight and/or region on the efficacy response.

{{Table 5: Percentage of ACR responders at Week 24 by weight: studies WA22762 and NA25220 vs. historical pooled IV Data (ITT population).}}
Table 5 presents the percentage of ACR responders (ACR20, ACR50, ACR70) at Week 24, stratified by weight groups (<80 kg, 80 to <100 kg, and ≥100 kg) for patients in Studies WA22762 and NA25220, compared to historical pooled intravenous (IV) data. In this analysis, ACR refers to the American College of Rheumatology response criteria, TCZ stands for tocilizumab, SC indicates subcutaneous administration, IV refers to intravenous administration, DMARD is disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug, and MTX represents methotrexate. The treatment schedules included once weekly (QW), every 2 weeks (Q2W), and every 4 weeks (Q4W) dosing.
In Study WA22762, for patients receiving TCZ 162 mg SC QW with DMARD (N=631), among those weighing less than 80 kg (n=144), 74.3% achieved an ACR20 response, 50.7% achieved ACR50, and 23.6% achieved ACR70. In patients weighing between 80 and 100 kg (n=425), 65.0% achieved ACR20, 46.4% achieved ACR50, and 25.2% achieved ACR70. For those weighing ≥100 kg (n=62), 50.0% achieved ACR20, 33.9% achieved ACR50, and 12.9% achieved ACR70.
For the 8 mg/kg IV Q4W plus DMARD arm in WA22762 (N=631), among patients weighing <80 kg (n=146), 76.0% achieved ACR20, 52.7% achieved ACR50, and 35.6% achieved ACR70. In the 80 to <100 kg group (n=422), 65.8% achieved ACR20, 48.1% achieved ACR50, and 26.5% achieved ACR70. In the ≥100 kg group (n=63), 50.8% achieved ACR20, 22.2% achieved ACR50, and 4.8% achieved ACR70.
In Study NA25220, for TCZ 162 mg SC Q2W with DMARD (N=437), patients weighing <80 kg (n=119) showed 63.0% ACR20, 43.7% ACR50, and 23.5% ACR70 responses. In the 80 to <100 kg group (n=292), ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 response rates were 62.0%, 35.4%, and 19.5%, respectively. Among patients ≥100 kg (n=26), 38.5% achieved ACR20, 15.4% achieved ACR50, and only 3.8% achieved ACR70.
For the placebo group in NA25220 receiving SC Q2W plus DMARD (N=219), patients <80 kg (n=89) had ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 rates of 19.1%, 6.7%, and 3.4%, respectively. Those weighing 80 to <100 kg (n=150) had 13.2%, 7.9%, and 1.3% response rates, respectively. Patients ≥100 kg (n=11) showed ACR20 at 27.3%, ACR50 at 9.1%, and ACR70 at 0%.
Comparatively, in the pooled historical IV dataset, for TCZ 8 mg/kg IV Q4W plus DMARD (N=1575), the <80 kg group (n=377) had ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 rates of 63.7%, 37.7%, and 19.9%, respectively. For the 80 to <100 kg group (n=1073), the respective rates were 56.9%, 34.5%, and 17.4%. In the ≥100 kg group (n=120), the rates were 53.3% for ACR20, 33.3% for ACR50, and 15.0% for ACR70.
In the historical data for TCZ 4 mg/kg IV Q4W plus MTX (N=773), patients <80 kg (n=185) achieved 52.4% ACR20, 29.7% ACR50, and 9.5% ACR70 responses. In the 80 to <100 kg group (n=524), the response rates were 45.8%, 24.8%, and 9.2%, respectively. Among patients ≥100 kg (n=50), the rates were 25.0%, 10.0%, and 10.0% for ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70, respectively.
Finally, in the placebo IV + DMARD group (N=1168), for <80 kg patients (n=285), the rates were 23.4% for ACR20, 8.1% for ACR50, and 2.1% for ACR70. In the 80 to <100 kg group (n=773), they were 19.1%, 8.5%, and 1.3%, respectively. For ≥100 kg patients (n=105), placebo response rates were 18.1%, 10.5%, and 4.8%, respectively.
The data in Table 5 were sourced from WA22762 and NA25220 analyses, as well as pooled IV historical datasets. Specific response rates for ACR20/50/70 from historical IV arms were calculated from original filing outputs.

{{Figure 5: Correlation of continuous covariates.}}
Figure 5 presents the correlation of continuous covariates based on the Exposure-Efficacy Analyses of Tocilizumab (TCZ) from Phase III Studies WA22762 and NA25220 in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis. The plot shows pairwise scatter plots of continuous covariates, where individual data points are displayed, and red loess (local regression smoother) trend lines indicate the relationship trends. Correlation coefficients (R-values) are also presented between each pair of covariates.
The covariates analyzed include weight (WT), age, log-transformed rheumatoid factor (LogRF), log-transformed C-reactive protein (LogCRP), log-transformed interleukin-6 (LogIL6), and DAS28 scores (DAS).
Key findings from the figure:
The highest correlation observed was between LogCRP and DAS28, with a correlation coefficient of R = 0.59, indicating a moderate positive relationship between baseline C-reactive protein levels and DAS28 disease activity scores.
A moderate positive correlation was also found between LogIL6 and DAS28 (R = 0.30) and between LogRF and DAS28 (R = 0.20).
Other covariate pairs showed relatively weak correlations, generally with R-values below 0.25. For example, the correlation between weight and DAS28 was only R = -0.046, and between age and DAS28 was R = -0.0064, suggesting negligible relationships.
Similarly, correlations between weight and other variables (e.g., weight vs LogCRP, weight vs LogIL6) were minimal, with R-values near zero (e.g., R = 0.058 and R = -0.046).
The local regression lines (red lines) plotted across scatterplots indicate general trends in relationships, but most show very flat or mildly sloping patterns, confirming that strong linear relationships are rare among these variables.
The figure highlights that among the continuous covariates considered, CRP and IL-6 biomarkers are the most important drivers related to DAS28 disease activity, whereas baseline patient characteristics like weight and age do not strongly correlate with disease scores in this dataset.
The source of the figure is Figure 10 from the report of Exposure-Efficacy Analyses of Tocilizumab of Phase III Studies WA22762 and NA25220. The note emphasizes that the continuous covariates are shown as scatter points, with loess smoothing lines plotted, and correlation coefficients numerically summarized for each covariate pair.

{{2.3.1 Analysis Dataset}}
The dataset for exposure-safety response for population PK-neutrophil count analysis included dosing, neutrophil counts and covariate data from the Phase 3 studies WA22762 and NA25220. Only the data from the first 24-week dosing period of each study were included in the analysis. The number of subjects and observations in each study is shown in Table 7.

{{Table 7: Number of subjects and observations in each study.}}
Table 7 summarizes the number of subjects and observations included in each study, based on the Exposure-Safety Analyses of Tocilizumab (TCZ) from Phase III Studies WA22762 and NA25220 in Rheumatoid Arthritis. In Study WA22762, a total of 1,250 subjects contributed data, with 10,873 observations used in the analysis. A total of 67 observations were excluded as outliers. In Study NA25220, there were 637 subjects, with 4,997 observations included in the analysis, and 19 observations excluded as outliers. Combining both studies, the overall dataset consisted of 1,887 subjects, 15,870 observations, and 86 excluded observations due to outlier detection.
This comprehensive dataset formed the basis for the exposure-safety modeling described in the subsequent analysis. The source of this table is from Table 7 of the Exposure-Safety Analyses report for Tocilizumab in Phase III studies WA22762 and NA25220.

{{2.3.2 Model building}}

{{2.3.2.1 Exposure-response model for neutrophil counts}}
For the IV administration, the time-course of neutrophil counts was described by an indirect-response model with stimulation of elimination rate that was described by a sigmoidal function of TCZ serum concentration. An updated model was also used to describe the time-course of neutrophil counts following TCZ SC administration. The updated model combined an immediate direct effect (that affected all circulating neutrophils) with the slow effect described by the indirect response model (that affected only a fraction of the circulating neutrophils). During base model selection, prediction performance with the indirect-response model and the updated model were compared by visual inspection of diagnostic scatter plots, plausibility of the parameter estimates, precision of the parameter estimates, the minimum objective function value (OFV) and the number of estimated parameters. The difference in the OFV between hierarchical models is asymptotically χ² distributed with a degree of freedom equal to the difference in number of parameters between the two models in comparison. A p value of 0.001 for one additional parameter corresponds to a difference in the objective function of 10.83.
Full model with backward parameter elimination was used to establish the final covariate model. For full model, potential covariate-parameter relationships were identified based on scientific interest, mechanistic plausibility, knowledge gained from the previously developed model based on the IV data, and exploratory graphics. The full model did not simultaneously include effects of strongly correlated or collinear predictors. A similar backward elimination procedure to the one used for exposure-DAS28 response model was employed to derive the final covariate model. Please refer to section 2.2.2 for details.
{{2.3.2.2 Graphical analysis of relationships between observed TCZ concentrations and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) and time course of main safety parameters}}
Graphical analyses were used to explore potential relationships between drug exposure and safety responses in terms of SAE and other safety parameters. The following SAEs were evaluated: any SAE, SAE of infections and infestations, SAE of gastrointestinal disorders, SAE of cardiac disorders, SAE of neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps). The following safety parameters were evaluated: hematology (i.e., white blood cells, neutrophil, and platelets counts), biochemistry (i.e., total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), serum albumin, total protein, total cholesterol, cholesterol-HDL, cholesterol-LDL, and triglycerides)
Graphical analyses for potential relationships between TCZ concentration and SAE were carried out by highlighting the observed TCZ concentration profiles of SAE positive subjects from the pool of all individual observed TCZ concentration profiles for each SAE category, excluding subjects from study 25220 that escaped starting at week 12 (e.g. who switched from Q2W to QW regimen). Visual comparison was used to check whether SAE positive subjects were associated with higher overall drug concentrations when compared to the population pool.
Graphical analyses of the potential relationship between drug exposure and safety parameter responses were carried out by assessing the relationship between the observed values of the laboratory safety parameters and steady-state TCZ exposure (Ctrough). Ctrough value was computed using individual subject’s dosing history and the individual PK parameters from the final population PK model. Again, subjects from study 25220 that escaped at week 12 were excluded from the analysis. Equal number of subjects were assigned to low, medium, or high exposure categories based on Ctrough values within each treatment regimen. For each safety parameter, the individual observed tocilizumab concentration profiles were also overlaid and compared for subjects in each of the three exposure categories by treatment, and separately for placebo subjects from study 25220.

{{2.3.3 Model evaluation}}
The model evaluation procedure for exposure-neutrophil count model is similar to the one used for exposure-DAS28 response model. Refer to section 2.2.3 for details.

{{2.3.4 Results}}
Overall, both models provided the excellent fit of the data. Therefore, the more parsimonious indirect-response model was selected both as the final base model and consequently the final model.
For covariate evaluations, it was found that higher neutrophil count at baseline (BASE) was associated with males, smokers, and subjects with higher baseline C-reactive protein (CRP). Emax increased with increasing IL6 level. Therefore, the full model included the effects of CRP, age, and sex on all parameters, IL6 on Emax, concentration to achieve 50% effect (EC50), and baseline neutrophil count, PCOR and smoking (SMK) on baseline neutrophil count, and previous treatment with corticosteroids (PCOR) on first order elimination rate (Kout). Post backward elimination, the retained covariates were: baseline CRP, PCOR, and SMK on BASE; age on kout; gender on EC50, and baseline CRP and IL6 concentrations on Emax.
Key parameters of the final model were estimated with reasonable precision for the structural parameters (relative standard error (RSE) = 1.2 - 7.7%), for the variances of the inter-individual random effects (RSE = 3.7 - 12%), for the residual error (RSE = 1%), for the covariate effects on BASE (RSE = 1.5-5.8%), and for the covariate effects on the other parameters (RSE = 9.3 - 25.4%). In comparison, the inter-individual variability of the model parameters was high: 52.8%, 88.8%, and 152% for variances on Emax, EC50, and kout, respectively.
The final model passed all model evaluation criteria. Specifically, the predictive check evaluations (VPC, SVPC, PCS, and NPDE plots) showed that the model captured the central tendency and the inter-individual variability of neutrophil counts, as well as the identified relations between covariates and PK-PD parameters.
The magnitude of the covariate effects on model parameters is illustrated as in Table 8. The covariate effects on the neutrophil time course were also assessed using simulations. The covariates evaluated were gender, smoking, previous administration of corticosteroids, age, CRP, and IL6 for each dosing regimen. Overall, except for CRP on 162 mg following SC Q2W regimen, the effects of all the rest parameters on the neutrophil time profile did not seem to be clinically significant.
Based on the derived PK-PD model, rates of neutropenia for the three TCZ regimens following a 24-week dosing period and twice-a-week assessment for 32 weeks were simulated and the results are shown in Table 9. It was shown that the rates of neutropenia for all grades were lower for the 162 mg SC Q2W dosing regimen and were similar between 8 mg/kg IV Q4W and 162 mg SC QW regimens. More frequent sampling and high fluctuation of neutrophil counts due to high residual error led to higher than observed neutropenia rates.

{{Table 8: Covariate effects based on the final model.}}
Table 8 summarizes the covariate effects based on the final model. For the BASE parameter, C-reactive protein (CRP) in mg/L was evaluated with a median of 13.5 [0.2–205] and a reference value of 10. When the value was 1, the effect on BASE was -20.9% (95% CI: [-23.0%, -18.5%]), while at a value of 100, the effect was +26.5% (95% CI: [23.1%, 29.9%]). Previous corticosteroid therapy (PCOR) was also evaluated under BASE, comparing "Yes" versus "No" as covariate levels. Compared to "No," "Yes" was associated with a +22.9% effect (95% CI: [19.3%, 26.4%]). Smoking status (SMK) — smoker versus non-smoker — was evaluated, where being a smoker led to a +17.5% effect (95% CI: [13.2%, 21.9%]).
For k_out, age in years was evaluated with a median of 54 [18–86] and a reference of 50 years. At 20 years of age, the effect was -46.2% (95% CI: [-55.9%, -34.3%]), while at 80 years the effect was +37.4% (95% CI: [24.1%, 52.1%]).
For EC50, sex (female vs male) was examined. Females were used as the reference group. Being male resulted in a -22% effect on EC50 (95% CI: [-39.2%, -4.7%]).
For E_max, two covariates were evaluated: CRP and IL6. For CRP (mg/L) with a median of 13.5 [0.2–205] and a reference of 10, a CRP level of 1 yielded an effect of -13.6% (95% CI: [-19.7%, -7.1%]), while a CRP level of 100 yielded a +15.7% effect (95% CI: [7.6%, 24.5%]). For IL6, measured as Log(10IL6) in pg/mL, the median was 5.14 [1.39–10.7]. A Log(101) value served as the reference, and compared to it, a Log(1020) produced a -42.3% effect (95% CI: [-48.1%, -36.4%]) while a Log(1010) produced a +44.4% effect (95% CI: [35.1%, 54.5%]).
The data are sourced from Table 23 of the report of Exposure-Safety Analyses of Tocilizumab of Phase III Studies WA22762 and NA25220 in Rheumatoid Arthritis.

{{Table 9: Simulated incidence of neutropenia (Grades 1 to 4) for each dosing regimen.}}
Table 9 summarizes the simulated incidence of neutropenia, classified by Grades 1 to 4, for each dosing regimen. For the 162 mg once weekly subcutaneous (SC) dosing regimen, the incidence of Grade 1 neutropenia was 58.0% (standard deviation 1.9%), Grade 2 was 47.3% (1.8%), Grade 3 was 19.4% (1.5%), and Grade 4 was 2.08% (0.57%). For the 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks intravenous (IV) dosing regimen, the incidence of Grade 1 neutropenia was 57.7% (2.0%), Grade 2 was 47.3% (1.9%), Grade 3 was 19.0% (1.5%), and Grade 4 was 1.95% (0.51%). For the 162 mg every 2 weeks SC dosing regimen, the incidence rates were lower, with Grade 1 neutropenia at 40.8% (2.3%), Grade 2 at 31.8% (2.3%), Grade 3 at 11.5% (1.5%), and Grade 4 at 1.19% (0.51%). In the placebo group, the simulated incidence rates were notably lower, with Grade 1 neutropenia at 17.1% (2.5%), Grade 2 at 11.4% (2.0%), Grade 3 at 2.4% (1.0%), and Grade 4 at 0.39% (0.46%).
These data are sourced from Table 25 in the report of the Exposure-Safety Analyses of Tocilizumab of Phase III Studies WA22762 and NA25220 in Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Graphical exploration for potential relationship between drug exposure and SAE did not identify any prominent correlation. Overall, the occurrences of all types of SAEs were low (<5% for all SAE combined), and no pattern was found between the occurrence of SAEs of any categories (i.e., “Infections and Infestations”, “Gastrointestinal disorders", "Cardiac Disorders", "Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps)") and treatments based on sponsor’s assessment. Subjects who experienced SAEs were not apparently associated with higher TCZ concentrations.
Safety parameters, which were graphically evaluated for potential relationships between exposure category in terms of Ctrough and time course patterns, included white blood cells, neutrophil counts, platelets, ALT, AST, total bilirubin, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, serum albumin, and total protein.
For white blood cells and neutrophils, it was found that time to steady-state counts and the steady-state levels decreased with increasing exposure. For ALT, AST, total bilirubin, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides, slight increase in their levels over time were observed in all categories of exposure compared to the placebo group. However, no strong relationships between the increase and TCZ exposure or treatment regimen were identified. Similar patterns held for serum albumin levels with an exception that the combined data of the SC regimens seemed to show a slightly higher increase in the high exposure group compared to the low exposure group. For total protein, slight decrease over time was observed for all regimens including placebo and the decrease was not apparently related to drug exposure or treatment.
Overall, the hematological safety parameters demonstrated higher than placebo safety risk that approached plateau at high exposures. In general, potential hematology safety risks were similar between the 162 mg SC QW and 8 mg/kg IV Q4W regimens. For the 162 mg SC Q2W, it was associated with less safety parameter response and higher variability was observed across its associated exposure categories.

{{Reviewers’ analysis/comment}}
Based on sponsor’s safety report, the overall AE and infection rate was higher in the TCZ 162 mg QW SC treatment (study WA22762) than in the 162 mg Q2W SC treatment (study NA25220)(Table 10) , although there was a lack of exposure response relationship within each treatment regimen.
The protocols for both pivotal studies WA22762 and NA25220 allowed for dose interruption of an infusion, skipping a dose, or dose reduction for the management of AEs (e.g., opportunistic infections and serious infections, GI perforations, demyelinating disorders, hematologic abnormalities and bleeding events, elevated liver enzymes, cardiovascular events and elevated lipids, malignancies, local ISRs, and hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis after SC injection). The most commonly reported system organ classes (SOCs) with AEs leading to dose modification included Infections and Infestations.
As shown by Table 11, it was found that the incidence of AEs leading to a dose modification/interruption either at Week 24 or at the clinical cutoff was significantly higher for 162 mg QW SC treatment (study WA22762) than for 162 mg Q2W SC treatment (Study NA25220: 36.1% vs. 16.7%). In comparison, the incidence was comparable between 162 QW SC and 8 mg/kg IV treatment (study WA22762: 36.1% for SC vs. 30.7% for IV).
Consistent with IV TCZ treatment as well as characterized by the exposure-neutrophil countmodel, SC administration of TCZ induced an exposure/dose-dependent decrease inneutrophil counts. As observed in study WA22762, the rates for Grade 1 or 2 neutropenia for SC TCZ QW and IV Q4W regimens were comparable with Week 24 IV TCZ data at Week 24. Although the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia at Week 24 was low and balanced across SC TCZ and IV TCZ dosing regimens, no evaluation has been reported whether this was attributable to dose modification or interruption due to safety events. 
Based on the exposure-neutrophil count model simulations, the safety risk for grades 1-4 neutropenia was the lowest in the 162 mg Q2W SC treatment among all the evaluated active treatment regimens (i.e., 162 mg QW SC, 162 mg Q2W SC, and 8 mg/kg Q4W IV). The neutropenia risk was almost doubled in the 162 mg QW SC and 8 mg/kg Q4W IV treatment regimens compared to the 162 Q2W SC treatment regimen (19% vs 12% for grade 3, and 2.0% vs 1.2% for grade 4). The simulated trend is consistent with the observed trend as summarized in Table 12 in the intent to treat (ITT) PK population for grades 1&2 neutropenia incidence. It was also found the incidence of thrombocytopenia and ALTelevation was also lowest in the 162 mg Q2W SC treatment among the three activetreatments.
Although the sponsor failed to identify a relationship between TCZ exposure and SAE incidence, the graphical analyses for potential relationship between drug exposure and SAE were mainly based on visual assessment and may be potentially involving subjective judgment. A reference to clinical safety review needed for an overall evaluation.

Table 10 presents the rates of all adverse events (AEs) and infection AEs by observed Week 24 Ctrough quartiles in the ITT-PK population for studies WA22762 and NA25220. In the NA25220 study (162 mg TCZ SC q2w), across quartiles Q1 to Q4, the number of patients remained consistent at 81, 80, 80, and 80, respectively. Mean Ctrough values increased from 0.2 µg/mL in Q1 to 17.9 µg/mL in Q4, while the median Ctrough ranged from 0.1 µg/mL in Q1 to 16.8 µg/mL in Q4. Total patient years per quartile were around 37.0–37.5 years. The number of all AEs decreased from 177 in Q1 to 136 in Q4. AE rates per 100 patient-years dropped from 472 (95% CI: 405–547) in Q1 to 365 (95% CI: 313–442) in Q3 and 426 (95% CI: 363–499) in Q4. For infection and infestation AEs, the number decreased from 40 (Q1) to 18 (Q3), then rose slightly to 27 (Q4). Infection AE rates per 100 patient-years followed a similar pattern, dropping from 107 (95% CI: 76–145) in Q1 to 61 (95% CI: 44–89) in Q3, and increasing to 73 (95% CI: 46–103) in Q4.
For study WA22762 (162 mg TCZ SC qw), the number of patients per quartile was consistent at approximately 129–131. Mean Ctrough levels increased from 14.6 µg/mL (Q1) to 80.1 µg/mL (Q4), and median Ctrough levels rose from 15.4 µg/mL (Q1) to 72.5 µg/mL (Q4). Total patient years were around 63.0–64.3 across quartiles. The number of all AEs remained relatively stable (313 to 346 events), with AE rates per 100 patient-years ranging from 495 (95% CI: 418–528) to 556 (95% CI: 498–618). The number of infections ranged from 60 (Q1) to 72 (Q4), and infection AE rates varied from 108 (95% CI: 83–136) to 116 (95% CI: 91–146).
In the WA22762 study arm (8 mg/kg TCZ IV q4w), the number of patients across quartiles was 134–135. Mean Ctrough levels increased from 4.1 µg/mL (Q1) to 38.9 µg/mL (Q4), with median Ctrough levels from 4.1 µg/mL to 36.9 µg/mL. Total patient years were consistent (around 63.3–65.0 years). The number of all AEs increased slightly from 349 to 367, and AE rates per 100 patient-years ranged from 539 (95% CI: 484–590) to 563 (95% CI: 506–624). The number of infections varied from 60 (Q1) to 78 (Q4), and infection AE rates per 100 patient-years increased slightly from 94 (95% CI: 72–121) to 123 (95% CI: 97–154).
It is noted that Q1–Q4 refer to the subgroups defined by Ctrough exposure quartiles (from lowest to highest Ctrough).

{{Table 11: Overview of AEs Leading to Dose Modifications/ Interruptions in Studies WA22762 and NA25220 until Clinical Cutoff Safety Population.}}
Table 11 provides an overview of adverse events (AEs) leading to dose modifications or interruptions in Studies WA22762 and NA25220 until clinical cutoff, analyzing the safety population. In Study WA22762, for the 162 mg subcutaneous (SC) tocilizumab (TCZ) administered once weekly (QW) alongside a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) (N=631), patients were followed for a total duration of 454.20 patient-years (PY). In this group, 228 patients (36.1%) experienced AEs requiring dose modification or interruption, totaling 412 AEs, corresponding to an incidence rate of 96.87 AEs per 100 PY with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of (88.03, 106.36).
For the 8 mg/kg intravenous (IV) TCZ administered every four weeks (Q4W) plus DMARD group in WA22762 (N=631), the total study duration was 401.02 PY. 194 patients (30.7%) experienced AEs, corresponding to 294 total AEs and an AE incidence rate of 78.0 AEs per 100 PY, with a 95% CI of (70.35, 87.98).
In Study NA25220, for patients receiving 162 mg SC TCZ every two weeks (Q2W) plus DMARD (N=437), the total study duration was 222.09 PY. Here, 73 patients (16.7%) experienced AEs leading to dose modification or interruption, with 98 total AEs reported, corresponding to an incidence rate of 46.38 AEs per 100 PY and a 95% CI of (37.85, 56.25).
The analyses for the SC TCZ arms included all patients who received SC TCZ using the prefilled syringe (PFS) during the double-blind period starting from their first dose. Data after any switch to IV TCZ (for WA22762) or to an autoinjector device (AI, in NA25220) during the open-label extension were excluded from analysis.
Similarly, analyses for the IV TCZ arm included only patients who received IV TCZ during the double-blind period from their first dose; any data after switching to SC TCZ during the open-label extension were excluded.
Multiple occurrences of the same AE in an individual were counted separately.
The clinical cutoff dates were January 16, 2012, for Study WA22762 and May 28, 2012, for Study NA25220.
This information was derived from Table 11, sourced from the report of Summary of Clinical Safety.

ALT elevation Grade 2 incidence was around 4–5%, and ALT Grade 3 occurrence was minimal.

{{Reviewer’s overall comments}}
In conclusion, TCZ 162 mg SC QW and 8 mg/kg IV Q4W treatment regimens demonstrated comparable efficacy. The TCZ 162 SC Q2W dosing regimen also showed clinically superior efficacy improvements to placebo. However, the efficacy effect is less pronounced in > 100 kg weight group for 162 kg SC QW treatment compared to 162 kg SC QW and 8 mg/kg IV Q4W treatments (50.0%, 50.8%, 38.5%, and 27.3% for 162 mg SC QW, 162 mg SC Q2W, 8 mg/kg IV Q4W, and placebo in terms of ACR20 responses, respectively, at Week 24 in ITT population). By directly comparing the ACR20 responses of patients weighting > 100 kg between SC QW and SC Q2W treatments (i.e., 50.0% vs. 38.2%), the decreased ACR responses for 162 mg SC Q2W treatment is likely to be associated with less drug exposure. In addition, it was reported that a substantial % of escape patients who escalated from the Q2W SC regimen to the QW SC regimen showed an improvement in efficacy. Therefore, dose escalation from SCQ2W to SC QW for patients weighting > 100 kg to gain therapeutic advantage is reasonable.
Clinical data supported the starting dosing regimen of 162 mg SC Q2W for patients weighing < 100 kg, mainly based on four reasons. First, the efficacy response in terms of ACR20 were observed to be >60% for both SC QW and SC Q2W regimens for patients weighting < 100 kg. Second, higher safety risk were observed across studies for SC QW than for SC Q2W in terms of % of patients with any AE and grades 1 & 2 neutropenia. The exposure –safety model also predicted higher grades 3 & 4 neutropenia risk for QW regimen. Third, overview of AEs leading to dose modifications/ interruptions in studies WA22762 and NA25220 until Week 24 or clinical cutoff in safety population showed that the incidence of such events is higher in the SC QW treatment than in the SC Q2W treatment (27.3% vs. 13.5% at Week 24 and 36.1% vs. 16.7% at clinical cutoff). Starting from SC Q2W regimen lends the opportunity to patients for tolerance to TCZ regimen and has the advantage of less dose modifications/interruptions. Fourth, the approved IV dosing regimen also recommends starting from a low dose of 4 mg/kg Q4W that can be escalated to 8 mg/kg Q4W based on clinical response.

{{IV and SC PK Profile Comparison Study BP22065}}
The figure presents a comparison of TCZ (tocilizumab) plasma concentration over time between intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) administrations at two different dose levels: 162 mg and 81 mg.
The x-axis represents Time (hours), ranging from 0 to 480 hours on a log-linear scale.
The y-axis represents TCZ concentration (µg/mL).
Groups Compared:
162 mg TCZ SC: Represented by solid circles (●).
81 mg TCZ SC: Represented by open circles (○).
162 mg TCZ IV: Represented by solid triangles (▲).
81 mg TCZ IV: Represented by open triangles (△).
Key Observations:
IV administration (both 162 mg and 81 mg doses) results in a higher initial plasma concentration (Cmax) compared to SC administration.
After IV dosing, there is a sharp decline in TCZ plasma concentration, characteristic of direct systemic availability and rapid distribution/elimination.
SC administration shows a slower absorption phase, leading to a lower Cmax but a more sustained concentration over time.
At later timepoints (after ~48–72 hours), the SC groups maintain higher plasma concentrations relative to the declining IV groups.
Dose Dependency:
Higher doses (162 mg) consistently result in higher TCZ plasma levels compared to lower doses (81 mg) for both IV and SC routes.
Error bars (standard deviations or standard errors) indicate variability in concentration measurements, particularly evident at earlier time points after IV dosing.
Interpretation:
IV dosing leads to rapid high exposure followed by steep elimination.
SC dosing provides more gradual systemic absorption, leading to more sustained plasma exposure.
The sustained exposure with SC dosing could be favorable for maintaining therapeutic drug levels over longer periods without reaching high peak concentrations that could be associated with toxicity.

{{PK Profiles for Different Regimens Adapted from IND11972, May 2010}}
figure displays the mean ± standard deviation (SD) serum tocilizumab (TCZ) concentrations over time following different dosing regimens. The groups evaluated included 81 mg SC (subcutaneous) Q2W/QW, 162 mg SC Q2W, 162 mg SC QW, 4 mg/kg IV Q4W, and 8 mg/kg IV Q4W. The x-axis shows time in weeks, extending to 32 weeks, while the y-axis displays serum TCZ concentration in micrograms per milliliter (µg/mL) ranging from 0 to 180 µg/mL. The IV groups (4 and 8 mg/kg IV Q4W) demonstrated sharp peaks in serum concentration immediately following each infusion, followed by rapid declines, highlighting the pulsatile nature of intravenous dosing. In contrast, SC dosing produced smoother profiles with less dramatic fluctuation between doses. Among the SC regimens, 162 mg SC QW produced the highest and most stable serum concentrations, maintaining levels more consistently between injections. In comparison, 162 mg SC Q2W resulted in substantially lower and more variable TCZ levels. Importantly, a red annotation on the graph emphasizes that the dosing regimen of 162 mg Q2W results in more than a proportional reduction in exposure compared to 162 mg QW, suggesting non-linear pharmacokinetics where doubling the dosing interval leads to greater than a 50% reduction in systemic exposure. The 81 mg SC Q2W/QW group initially showed lower concentrations when dosed every two weeks, with an increase in levels once switched to weekly dosing. Clinically, these data suggest that weekly SC dosing (162 mg QW) maintains therapeutic concentrations more effectively than biweekly dosing (162 mg Q2W), and that biweekly dosing may not sustain adequate exposure in certain patient populations, particularly those with higher drug clearance or body weight. The IV groups, included from a separate Phase 2 study (LRO301), are illustrated for comparison and show the characteristic rapid spike and decline associated with IV administration, unlike the smoother steady exposure with SC dosing.

{{Dose Selection}}
Chosen on the basis of PK, PD, and safety data from two Phase I/II studies (MRA227JP and NP2263) in RA patients
TCZ SC dose regimens of 81 mg and 162 mg q2w/qw were tested
PD profiles (CRP, ESR, and sIL-6R) of the TCZ SC 162 mg QW regimen were found to be most comparable to the TCZ IV 8 mg/kg dosing regimen
Dose regimen of 162 mg SC Q2W also increased levels of the sIL-6R–TCZ complex, achieved CRP normalization, and resulted in an ESR reduction from baseline
Despite being slower and less pronounced compared with the 162 mg qw dose regimen, the PD responses with the 162 mg q2w regimen were superior to the lower SC doses tested (81 mg q2w/qw)

{{Summary of PD}}
Outlines key pharmacodynamic (PD) evaluations for tocilizumab (TCZ). Serum concentrations of IL-6, soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R), C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were measured and summarized both graphically and descriptively. These studies were conducted across two populations: healthy volunteers and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.
A representative figure is presented in the slide showing the mean ± standard deviation (SD) of serum IL-6 concentrations over time (expressed in weeks). The graph compares three groups:
MRA 81 mg/2W (every two weeks),
MRA 162 mg/2W, and
MRA 162 mg/W (weekly).
Key observations from the figure:
At the start of dosing, IL-6 levels rise sharply across all groups.
Over time, IL-6 concentrations stabilize at a lower level, with weekly dosing (162 mg/week) showing a more sustained and controlled IL-6 profile compared to biweekly dosing.
Variability is evident, especially in the early weeks, as shown by the wide error bars.
Weekly administration (162 mg/QW) appears to result in more consistent IL-6 suppression compared to 2-weekly administration.
The overall takeaway is that dosing frequency influences IL-6 concentration patterns, with weekly dosing providing smoother pharmacodynamic profiles, an important consideration for RA management.
